Strange Fate Core
===============

Contains the various resources used to take the Strange Fate SRD and make the ruleset Fate Core-compatible.

OriginalSRD contains thecosmicgoose's original PDF, patched together from the Kerberos Club Fate PDF, plus the Word doc conversion I did to make it easier to grab the text.

UpdatedSRD is the Strange Fate SRD, cleaned up and reformatted using Markdown, plus the 1.0 proof version of the PDF generated from this, which was used as the baseline for the Strange Fate Core project proper.

CoreSource contains the files for the work-in-progress update to make Strange Fate work with Fate Core.
