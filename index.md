## Strange Fate: The Original SRD

This is Strange Fate as extracted from the Fate version of The Kerberos Club. [Read about the history of the Strange Fate SRD](#dummy).

As this version is based on a prior revision of the Fate ruleset, I do not intend to maintain it. I will happily accept pull requests for minor edits. If someone is interested in maintaining it, please let me know. I will be glad to let you fork this repo and make your copy the canonical version.

## Strange Fate Core

The main purpose of this site is ongoing development on the Open Content portion of Strange Fate to bring it in line with Fate Core.
