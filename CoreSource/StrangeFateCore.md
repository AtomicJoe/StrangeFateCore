## Gifts and Fate Points
Gifts bend the rules a little where your character is concerned. You might have a Gift that gives you a special piece of equipment or that makes one of your aspects more powerful or that provides a little boost to some of your skills in the right circumstances. They're sort of a halfway point between aspects and skills, in that they have concrete mechanical effects, but it's up to you to define the specifics within the guidelines provided. Every character has at least one Gift. We'll discuss them in the Gifts section on page 244.

## If You've Played Fate Before: Skills, Refresh and Gifts
If you're familiar with the Fate system, here's a quick rundown on how we handle skills and Refresh. This is a point-based iteration of Fate. You'll use skill points to buy skills, and Refresh points to buy everything else. Characters start with 30 skill points, but a character's Refresh (the number of Fate Points he has at the start of each session) depends on the time period when the story takes place. Refresh starts at 6 in the Early Century, 8 in the Middle Century, or 10 in the Late Century. Refresh is also a currency in character creation -- you'll spend it on Power Tiers (which we'll discuss later) and Gifts, which take the place of stunts found in many other Fate games.

# Character Creation
Creating a character for Strange Fate occurs in six basic steps:
 * Pick an Archetype, and define aspects for both this and your first Conviction.
 * Buy Skills (Common, Unique, and Strange, as applicable).
 * Buy Gifts (if desired; everyone gets one Gift for free).

Note that this is only a recommended order -- you may find it useful to switch it up, if that feels more comfortable. You'll also find that some of these steps are interconnected. For example, Unique and Strange skills often constrain your aspect choices, which is why aspects are listed after skills above.

So then! Let's get into it.

## Pick Archetype
Your Archetype defines the broad outlines of your character concept, whether a master of the secrets of the Orient, a mad inventor, a deposed goddess, the last Martian, or  anything in between. The available Archetypes are:

* Adept
* Alien
* Anachronist
* Artificial
* Faerie
* Godling
* Changed
* Magus
* Mutant
* Super-Normal

Each has a full description in the Archetypes chapter. Your choice of Archetype will guide one of your aspect choices later.

## Buy Skills

You start with 30 skill points. Common skills cost a number of points equal to their rating, so a Fair (+2) skill costs 2 points. As the name implies, Common skills are typical areas of training or experience for the average citizen, such as riding a horse, scouring a crime scene for clues, or throwing a punch. Any unrated Common skills are treated as if their rating were Mediocre (+0).

Unique and Strange skills -- skills you design from the ground up -- often cost quite a bit more than Common skills.

Unique skills can represent occupations, lifestyles, areas of training, or any other collection of thematically connected abilities a normal human being might acquire. They're more specialized than Common skills, and a more concrete way to further distinguish your character.

Strange skills, on the other hand, transcend the abilities of the common man.

Unique skills and Strange skills are detailed further in the Skills section.

All skills are ranked on one of five Power Tiers:

* Mundane
* Extraordinary
* Superhuman
* Ascendant
* Godlike

By default, every skill starts out in the Mundane Tier -- the realm of the ordinary human being. All other Power Tiers represent commensurately greater increases in ability and effectiveness.

Player characters start with 30 skill points with which to buy skills. Improving a skill's Power Tier is detailed further in the Skills section.

## Define Aspects
[TBD: Talk about specific aspects you have to assign as part of Strange Fate]

## Buy Gifts
Gifts are special little rules-bending features of your character, such as conferring a small bonus to a skill in a limited circumstance, giving you a special piece of equipment or sidekick, or letting you use one skill in place of another. There are six Gifts: Companion, Impact, Signature Aspect, Skilled, and Theme. Everyone starts with one Gift for free; buying more is purely optional. Gifts are described in more detail in the Gifts section, page 244.

## Refine Details
Certain skills can add more boxes to these stress tracks if the skills are rated high enough. The more boxes in the track, the more resilient to that type of stress you are. You can find out more about how stress tracks work on page 324 in the Conflict section.

Certain skills in a higher Power Tier can let a character take additional consequences, as discussed in the Skills section.

## Types of Aspects
* Free: Anything you want. Free aspects have no restrictions on how they're defined.
* Archetype: A brief phrase that describes your character's basic concept and relates to your Archetype. The Archetypes chapter has a list of example aspects for each Archetype.
* Conviction: A powerful driving force in the character's life: a sense of honor or duty, a tie to family or faith, a taste for debauchery, or uncovering forbidden secrets. A Conviction can also be one in the rightness of a relationship: an absolute faith in one's True Love, or an unremitting hatred of an enemy. Most of all, a Conviction must be driving. It must demand action. Compelling a Conviction aspect works a little differently than normal; see page 187, How Aspects Work, for a proper explanation. Every character has at least one Conviction aspect.
* Complication: A Drawback reflecting how a Unique or Strange skill has complicated the character's life, such as "Criminal Past," "Lonely At The Top," or "I'm not an animal -- I'm a human being!" More information on Complication aspects can be found in Extras and Drawbacks.

## Archetypes
Each Strange character has an Archetype, as mentioned in the character creation guidelines. Archetypes are a way of focusing your character concept and guiding some of your choices, but the list below is hardly exhaustive. If you find you have an idea for a character that just doesn't fit the ones described here, use these as a guideline and work with your GM to come up with a new Archetype that does what you want it to do.

The Archetypes are displayed in the following format:

### Archetype Name
**Requirements:** Thematic constraints or mandatory Drawbacks for the Archetype's Strange skills. 
**Description:** A broad outline of what the Archetype means and encompasses.
**Example Aspects:** Aspects that may fit the Archetype. 
**Invoke when:** Some sample situations in which invoking the Archetype aspect would be appropriate. 
**Compel to:** Some other sample situations in which the GM could reasonably compel the Archetype aspect.

### Adept
**Requirements:** Physical or mental ability. 
**Description:** The world offers many possibilities for Adepts, those who transcend human limitations through the tireless study of one esoteric practice or another. The martial arts secrets of China and Japan, the yogic practices of India, the mystical meditations of Tibet -- even without exoticism, the age is full of health advice, medical quacks and patent exercise regimes. With the touch of the Strange, superhuman ability might rise from even something prosaic.
**Example Aspects:** Om Mani Padme Hum, Trained by Wong Kei-Ying, Secrets of the Tiger Clan.
**Invoke when:** Calling on your training, recalling something obscure related to your chosen discipline, acting all mysterious and exotic. 
**Compel to:** Defend the reputation of your school or master, obey the precepts of your traditions, fight with honor.

### Alien
**Requirements:** None.
**Description:** Unlike in the speculative fiction of the age, the ancient civilizations of the Moon, Mars, Venus, and further afield are all long dead and ashes by the 1800s -- but that's not to say ancient remnants of those prehuman races might not be hiding out there, waiting to awaken. Closer to home there are the inhuman inhabitants of  sunken  Atlantis  and  Pacifica, the subhuman ape-men of the Congo, and the attenuated and ethereal winged men clinging to the slopes of the world's most forbidding peaks. Aliens in The Kerberos Club are unique, survivors of dead races, lost beings cut off from their homes. Finding a way to survive in the societies of Man is sometimes their greatest challenge. 
**Example Aspects:** "My kingdom lies beneath the waves," Last Martian On Earth, Man of Steel. 
**Invoke when:** Using an ability related to your extraterrestrial origin, deciphering an alien script, negotiating with another alien.
**Compel to:** Be unfamiliar with the nuances of contemporary society, come to the aid of one of your brethren, put yourself at a disadvantage in an effort to "fit in."

### Anachronist
**Requirements:** Any Strange skills representing the Anachronist's inventions must have the Focus Flaw. 
**Description:** You are an inventor -- one part Da Vinci's brilliance, one part Tesla's innovation, with a dash of Edison's persistence for flavor. In your laboratory, you construct devices that beggar the imagination of the world's greatest scientific minds. Mad vision and superhuman inspiration combine to do the impossible. Some Anachronists specialize in a single kind of miraculous innovation or a theme, such as steam, chemical formulations, electricity, or the invisible power of radium. Others are true polymaths, masters of all science, some totally unknown to man, some forbidden by God. Of all the Archetypes, those who use science to create miracles are among the most accepted by society, though they often betray a shocking lack of foresight when anticipating the consequences of their innovations. 
**Example Aspects:** "I'm not a mad scientist -- just an angry one," The Wonders of This Age Are Born of Science, Curious Inventions of Every Kind.
**Invoke when:** Operating, repairing, or creating one of your inventions, figuring out a piece of advanced technology, impressing someone with your scientific prowess. 
**Compel to:** Indulge in techno-babble when just talking like a normal person would be far preferable, prioritize scientific knowledge over people, create a ground-breaking technological wonder without any regard for things like "morals" or "ethics."

### Artificial
**Requirements:** At least one Strange skill must have a Complication aspect related to your particular brand of artificiality.
**Description:** The creation of artificial life is something of an obsession for inventors and sorcerers alike. Men are sewn from the bodies of the dead like Mary Shelley's monster. Gods are served by living statues. Rabbi Judah Loew's Golem might still walk the Earth, perhaps granted a soul by the utterance of words; men of clockwork, ladies of brass, children with perfect porcelain faces. You are one of these unnatural beings, made in the image of your creator (more or less).

As an Artificial, damage you sustain cannot be healed by conventional medicine. Instead, you must be repaired like a machine using Craftsmanship (or any skill with the Repair trapping). This skill must equal or exceed the Power Tier of your Endurance (or other applicable skill with the Stress Capacity \[Health\] trapping). 
**Example Aspects:** Self-Made Man, Clockwork Juggernaut, The Golem of Cheapside.
**Invoke when:** Sustaining damage from a physical attack, displaying machine-like stamina, frightening peasants.
**Compel to:** Have difficulty relating to human beings, hide your true nature from unfriendly eyes, flee from a torch-and-pitchfork-wielding mob of frightened peasants.

### Changed
**Requirements:** None, but at least one of your Strange skills must come with a Complication reflecting the nature of your alteration.
**Description:** You're a human modified by science, sorcery, or something else, to be something more -- a natural consequence of having Anachronistic inventors making miracles with science and occultists channeling the powers of capricious otherworldly beings. Self-experimentation is also a favorite pursuit of over-extended inventors seeking validation of their ideas at any cost.
**Example Aspects:** Transformed by Rosicrucian Alchemy, England's Foremost Steamborg, Doctor Dorian's Hypertonic Treatments.
**Invoke when:** Using your modifications to exceed the limits of normal human ability, know details about the processes that made you what you are.
**Compel to:** Run afoul of a scientist who'd like to dissect you in the name of Science, encounter difficulty relating to "natural" humans, have the sorcerous entity that changed you call on you to return the favor.

### Faerie
**Requirements:** At least one of your Strange skills must come with a Complication aspect, and you must take at least a Minor Weakness against iron. In addition, you must take the Faerie Glamour skill (see page 241) at any Power Tier.
**Description:** Notoriously capricious and casually cruel where mortals are concerned, the faerie race is one of infinite diversity of mind and body. Most are hardly more than beasts or specters of people, but some are sapient enough to rival or even exceed humanity. Regardless of their form or mind, all creatures of Faerie are inextricably bound by the three Laws: The Law of Oath, the Law of Form, and the Law of Self. See The Three Laws of Faerie for more information on playing this Archetype.
**Example Aspects:** Gossamer Wings and Sharp Teeth, Mercurial Changeling, Spirit of the Air.
**Invoke when:** Speaking with (or take more vigorous action against) others of Faerie origin, deceiving a mortal through tricks or illusion, putting yourself in danger in the course of fulfilling an oath.
**Compel to:** Obey one of the three Laws of Faerie, be discriminated against (in the later part of the century), chafe under Queen Victoria's authority.

### Godling
**Requirements:** Your Strange skills must be tied to your divine heritage or sphere of influence.
**Description:** You're not the God, but a god, surely; or perhaps you're related to a divine entity of some sort and have been exiled to spend your unnaturally long life in the mortal realm. In truth, the British Empire is ruled by one such as this, but She is far from the only Divinity to walk the Earth. The smug certainty of English religion might dismiss the religions of non-Christian lands as superstition, but if one is not blinded by dogma, there is evidence of their providence walking among the milling crowds. Look to the world's religions, living and dead, and you will find thousands of fantastic characters.
**Example Aspects:** Son of Thor, The Eternal Energy of Kali, "Shu'Shub Tso'gorath! Shu'Shub Tso'gorath!" 
**Invoke when:** Impressing the mortals with your divinity, consorting with others of your kind, recalling historical trivia from your long years on Earth (or beyond).
**Compel to:** Cross over from "impressive" to "arrogant," be targeted by followers of an enemy deity (or the enemy deity itself), have to face one of the many enemies you've made during your long years on Earth (or beyond).

### Human Oddity
**Requirements:** Physical or mental ability. In addition, at least one of your Strange skills must come with a Major Complication aspect reflecting your particular brand of oddness.
**Description:** Some people are just born wrong. Some unfortunates have no compensation for their oddities, but others, such as John Merrick the Elephantine Man, gain awesome powers as recompense. These individuals are truly Strangers, set apart and marked out by a society that has quite strong opinions on how one should dress act, and look.
**Example Aspects:** "I'm not an animal -- I'm a human being!", The Great and Mysterious Human Pretzel, The Feejee Mermaid of the Pacific.
**Invoke when:** Scaring off the ignorant, using one of your oddity-derived abilities, relating with others of your cursed kind.
**Compel to:** Be subjected to the scorn, persecution and deep-seated prejudice of a frightened populace, accidentally frighten off a would-be friend, finally succumb to the rage that's been slowly building inside you your entire life.

### Magus
**Requirements:** One of your Conviction aspects becomes your Obsession (see sidebar). See Magic: Forbidden Lore and Hidden Secrets on page 234 for further details on the different requirements for Sacred and Profane magicians.
**Description:**  Magical  traditions  are  many  and varied, but all demand one thing from those who find true powers amid the dross and lies and fantasies: dedication. To gain true sorcerous insight, one must put magic before all other things. One must shed attachments, like mystical gadgeteering -- the Magus creates items of power, either temporary or permanent. Profane magic is fast and flexible; Sacred magic is time-consuming and potentially world-altering. Profane magicians are required to purchase the Profane Works skill, and Sacred magicians are required to purchase the Sacred Works skill. These are both detailed in Magic: Forbidden Lore and Hidden Secrets.
**Example Aspects:** Inheritor of Arcane Secrets Dark and Terrible, Occult Conspirator, The Sacrificial Blade of Amon-Tur
**Invoke when:** Working your magic, unworking someone else's magic, calling on your occult knowledge. 
**Compel to:** Betray a friend in pursuit of power, face danger to deepen your understanding of magic, indulge in a distasteful and lurid ritual.

### Mutant
**Requirements:** At least one of your Strange skills must come with a Drawback related to your mutation. 
**Description:** Some people are born with unnatural abilities which see them isolated and alienated, often abandoned by terrified parents. That's you -- the next phase of human evolution. Due to some aberration of science or genetics, you and your ilk are physiologically different from common men and women. By the late-middle century, gangs roam the streets made up almost entirely of juvenile Strangers who use their powers to thieve and war with each other.
**Example Aspects:** Built Like a Brick Workhouse, Three-Eyed Curiosity, Psychokinetic Crime-Fighter. 
**Invoke when:** Proving to other Mutants you're "one of them," using your mutation(s) to your advantage. 
**Compel to:** Be pursued by an angry crowd of anti-Mutant Londoners, be unmistakably revealed as a Mutant at an inopportune time, come up against a rival Mutant street gang.

### Super-Normal
**Requirements:** Physical or mental ability. At least one of your Strange skills must come with a Conviction aspect. **Description:** You're an exceptional member of the human race, driven by an unrelenting desire to exceed the accepted limits of human ability. Among the ranks of the Super-Normal are romantics exploring the dark corners of the world, great leaders of men, and unhinged megalomaniacs barely clinging to a semblance of sanity. 
**Example Aspects:** Man of Action, Daring Explorer of the Congo, "I am as a lion among insects."
**Invoke when:** Impressing the common man, displaying a Super-Normal ability, pushing yourself beyond the bounds of humanity.
**Compel to:** Lose touch with the common man, rise to a challenge, grow overconfident in your abilities.

## Skills
Skills are made up of bundles of skill applications we call trappings. A trapping is something you can do with a skill, such as using your Marksmanship skill to shoot someone or leaping from rooftop to rooftop with Athletics. In most Fate games, these trappings are often more implicit than explicit, but in The Kerberos Club they're treated more concretely and take on additional importance. Here, skills are defined by their trappings, for reasons that will soon become apparent. For a full list of trappings, see the Trappings section.

## Common, Unique, and Strange
Skills come in three basic varieties: Common skills, Unique skills, and Strange skills.

The Common skill list is a group of pre-defined skills, such as Seamanship, Academics, or Occultism. Their trappings are set and immutable: All instances of Academics, from character to character, have the same trappings and work the same way, as do all instances of Empathy, Stealth, Contacting, and every other Common skill. In other words, this is more or less the skill list you might find in any game powered by Fate.

At 28 Common skills, this list might seem a bit overwrought at first, but many are highly contextual. Odds are your character can safely dismiss several of them out of hand right away. Never set foot on a boat? Don't even look at Seamanship. Is your game set in the Early Century? You can safely disregard Drive and Pilot -- tractor carriages and Aero Ships don't even exist yet. Street urchin? Resources and Science probably aren't your thing. And so on.

Unique skills are designed and named by the player -- collections of hand-picked trappings grouped together to represent an occupation, a lifestyle, a broad area of training or aptitude, or some other thematically linked set of abilities. Every trapping within a Unique skill must fit its theme. For example, a Unique skill called Royal Surgeon could encompass medical training and knowledge, connections within the medical community, and personal wealth, but not riding a horse, dodging bullets, or punching guys in the face. That's not to say that the character can't do those things -- only that since they aren't reasonably part of being a Royal Surgeon, they can't be included in that particular Unique skill. Taking a Unique skill lets you turn one of your Free aspects into an associated Complication aspect, to reflect how the part of the character's life represented by the skill has complicated her life, or a Conviction aspect, to reflect how it has informed or affected her beliefs. These aspects are a way of reinforcing the connection between who your character is and what your character can do. Plus, they lower the Unique skill's cost. A Unique skill's Power Tier can be either Mundane or Extraordinary; see below for more on Power Tiers.


> ## A World Without Common Skills? 
> It's entirely possible to drop Common skills altogether and just have players build every skill from scratch by default. But fair warning: There are some serious pitfalls here, not the least of which is the extra time and effort involved. In addition, when the majority of a character's skills are Common, he's more likely to have his bases covered. Using Unique skills for everything requires a little more care and system mastery, plus some additional player buy-in to ensure that things don't get out of hand.
>
> However, if you're fine with all of that, to start you'll want to up starting skill points from 30 to 45. You may find it useful to name Unique skills after aspects (or vice-versa) to help narrow down the character's areas of competence. Even more so than usual, the GM and players should keep a close eye on how well a skill's trappings fitting its themes. The danger here is that every skill might end up too broad, which may make characters a little one-note. If a Unique skill ends up with more than five or six trappings, that's probably a sign that it should be split in two (or even three).

Strange skills, unlike Common skills and Unique skills, confer powers and abilities beyond those of normal human beings. Like Unique skills, most Strange skills are composed of trappings selected by the player, but generally themed around some sort of capability manifested by the Strangeness. What makes a Strange skill? Strange skills let you do things far beyond the ken of ordinary mortals, such as shooting energy beams out of your eyes, throwing a locomotive engine through the Parliament Building, reading a barkeep's mind, summoning otherworldly allies -- in other words, superpowers. Anyone can have a Unique skill, but only Strangers can have Strange skills. This includes any Common skill of Superhuman Tier or greater. Every Strange skill must come with at least one Drawback, which imposes a limitation of sort in exchange for a skill point discount; see Extras and Drawbacks for more on these.

## Power Tiers
The significant differences in scale between the effectiveness of the ordinary Londoner's abilities and those of the most powerful Strangers are represented by Power Tiers.

A skill in the Mundane Tier is as effective as the efforts of an ordinary human being. In this Tier, a Great (+4) Athletics rating puts you among the ranks of the finest real-world athletes. A magical, Mundane Tier ability to conceal your identity will give you a disguise as convincing as one that could be achieved through conventional means.

If a skill's Tier surpasses the Mundane Tier, so does its effectiveness relative to the realm of "normal" human ability. This could be due to a lifetime of intense focus, or an uncanny talent. With an Athletics skill of Great (+4) in the Extraordinary Tier, you are a suspiciously exceptional athlete. You routinely run, jump, and climb with an ease and agility that the common man simply can't match, and even your worst efforts often exceed those of professional athletes whose skills rank in the Mundane Tier. A sorcerous disguise in the Extraordinary Tier is often convincing enough to fool the target's spouse for weeks on end.

Above the Extraordinary Tier -- through the Superhuman, Ascendant, and Godlike Tiers -- these increases in effectiveness only become more pronounced. If you possess an Athletics skill in the Godlike Tier, running up one side of Everest and down the other, or leaping across the Atlantic, is routine business. If you can cloak yourself in a Godlike Tier disguise, odds are good that you're descended from (or are) one of the world's trickster gods.

The Tier of a skill, if not Mundane, is indicated by an initial in parentheses after the skill's name -- (E) for Extraordinary, (S) for Superhuman, and so on. If a skill -- any skill, including Common skills -- is in the Superhuman, Ascendant, or Godlike Tiers, it's automatically a Strange skill.

When you face off against an opponent, first compare the Tiers of the skills you're using. If they're the same, such as Mundane vs. Mundane or Superhuman vs. Superhuman, each of you rolls 4dF and adds your skill rating, as normal. If they're different, whoever has the higher-Tier skill replaces one Fate die with a six-sided die for each Tier of difference. For example, if you're attacking with Good (+3) Fisticuffs (E) and your opponent is defending with Fair (+2) Athletics, you'll roll 3dF+1d6+3 and your opponent will roll 4dF+2. If your Fisticuffs were Superhuman instead of Extraordinary, you'd roll 2dF+2d6+3, while your opponent would still roll 4dF+2. If both of you were using skills of the same Tier, regardless of what that Tier were, you'd both roll 4dF and add your skill rating.

> The Power Tiers 
> Godlike  (G) 
> Ascendant  (A) 
> Superhuman  (S) 
> Extraordinary  (E) 
> Mundane

This method naturally gives the upper hand to whoever has the higher-Tier skill, but if there's only one Tier of 
difference, it's not an overwhelming advantage. There's still the very real possibility of rolling ---+1 on 3dF+1d6, after all. Anything greater than a single Tier of difference and the higher-Tier skill is virtually guaranteed to win. Consider that rolling 2dF+2d6 yields a minimum result of +0, and that's not even taking into account the skill rating itself -- in the worst-case scenario, a Superhuman skill pitted against a Mundane skill will always achieve a positive result. And that Mundane skill has no chance whatsoever against a Godlike skill. As it should be.

If a skill's Power Tier measures its effectiveness relative to that of the common man, your skill rating measures how it ranks against comparable skills in that Tier. For example, if you have Average (+1) Brawn (S), you're far stronger than the average person, but compared to others with Brawn (S), you're on the lower end of the scale.

Each Power Tier reduces your Refresh. See Power Tier and Refresh, page 206.

> But I Don't Like Fate Dice!
> Some versions of Fate eschew Fate dice in favor of d6-d6 (a positive d6 roll minus a negative d6 roll). If you prefer that, instead of replacing a Fate die with a d6 for a Power Tier, roll an extra d6. For example, an Extraordinary Tier skill vs. a Mundane Tier skill would mean rolling 2d6-d6 instead of 3dF+1d6.
> Be warned, though: Despite the fact that 3dF+1d6 and 2d6-1d6 have the same average (3.5), their high and low ranges vary significantly. The worst you can roll on 3dF+1d6 is -2 and the best is +9, while the worst you can roll with 2d6-d6 is -4 and the best is +11. This discrepancy only becomes more pronounced as the difference between Power Tiers increases. You should be aware of the tendency of the dice to become increasingly dominant if you're rolling regular dice rather than Fate dice.
> Another option is to use d6-d6 and just add +3 for each Tier of difference. This lacks a bit of the random factor and puts even more emphasis on Power Tiers if that's what you prefer.

## Invulnerability and Weakness
Some characters are especially resistant to certain types of attacks, like those mindless Automechanicals that don't scare easily, or are especially vulnerable to certain other types of attacks, such as a werewolf 's vulnerability to silver. These are handled in the game with limited Power Tier adjustments called Invulnerability and Weakness.

An Invulnerability improves your defenses against a narrow category of attacks by upgrading the effective Power Tier of your defense. This applies to any defensive skill you might bring to bear against the specified attack. A Minor Invulnerability provides a two-Tier upgrade (from Mundane to Superhuman, Extraordinary to Ascendant, Superhuman to Godlike, and so on), while a Major Invulnerability grants a four-Tier upgrade. Acceptable "narrow categories" must be consistent with the character's Archetype, and include things like fire (for a creature composed of volcanic rock), bludgeons (for a fellow with an especially stretchy body), and mind-affecting attacks (for an especially disciplined mentalist).

Alternately, the Invulnerability can be more broad, covering all physical attacks or all mental attacks, but this comes with certain repercussions. For one, it doubles the cost of the Invulnerability (see below). Secondly, the player has to decide if the Invulnerability is constantly active or must be consciously activated by the character. If the latter, it requires an Action on the character's turn (see the Conflicts section in Chapter 7: Running The Game) to activate or deactivate. This effectively means that it can't be switched on as an immediate reaction to a threat, but is a matter of conscious effort on the part of the character. Thirdly, while the Invulnerability is active, the character loses the ability to interact with the world within the bounds of the Invulnerability's scope. For example, a ghostly character with an Invulnerability to all physical attacks isn't able to physically affect the world -- he can't move or pick up objects, deal Health stress to corporeal enemies, and so on. A character with an Invulnerability to all mental attacks lacks the capacity to reason  or  think  independently.  He's less a "character" than one of those mindless Automechanicals mentioned above. Obviously, this is incongruous with being a player character, which demands independent reasoning and decision-making. Likewise, the only creatures Invulnerable to social attacks don't get invited to parties anyway, so this too is inappropriate for PCs.

A Weakness is just the opposite: a category of attacks against which the effective Power Tier of the character's defenses is downgraded by two Tiers (a Minor Weakness) or four Tiers (a Major Weakness). Werewolves are weak against silver. The Human Dynamo, the last Argonian on Earth, is Weak against argonite. Vampires have a Major Weakness against sunlight. However, instead of carrying a cost, in exchange for this chink in your armor your Weakness provides a cost rebate, as indicated on page 207. Note that the rebate provided isn't a function of how common or rare your Weakness is -- it's just about how much you want it to affect you. A GM who constantly presents antagonists with a knowledge of your Weakness and the means to exploit it is doing both you and the story a disservice. It's not that it should never come up -- of course it should -- but a hero facing an identical challenge time and again makes for a dull narrative.

As the GM, be judicious with how regularly you bring a character's Weakness into play. It should be a spice, not the main course. As the player, don't give your character a Weakness if you don't want to see your character trounced now and then by someone with the means, opportunity, and knowledge to exploit it.

## Tier Benefits
Many trappings can confer an additional benefit if their skill is in the Extraordinary Tier or above. This is called a Tier Benefit. For example, the Stress Capacity trapping's Tier Benefit in the Extraordinary Tier is Armor 1 against stress of the trapping's scope (Health, Composure, or Reputation). The number of Tier Benefits a single skill provides cannot exceed its skill rating. These Tier Benefits are chosen when the skill's Power Tier is determined, and remain "locked in"  thereafter. For  instance, the Physical Force, Stress Capacity, and Leap trappings all come with Tier Benefits. If you put all three of them in a Fair (+2) skill, you'll have to pick which two Tier Benefits the character will actually receive and be able to use. Later on, if you're able to increase that skill's rating to Good (+3), you can add the third Tier Benefit to the character.

### Putting It Together
Skills of all stripes are purchased using skill points. A common skill's cost in skill points is equal to its rating (+1 to +4), regardless of how many trappings it might have.

To figure out the cost of a Unique or Strange skill, you'll use the Skill Trapping Diagram on page 207.

As you can see, the diagram consists of boxes and lines. Each box is labeled with a trapping name, with either solid or dotted borders. Many of these boxes are connected by lines, whether thin, thick, or dotted. We'll refer to these connected boxes as chains.

Start by choosing a trapping for the skill. This can be anywhere in the diagram. If the trapping has a solid border, it costs 1 skill point; if it's dotted, it's 2 skill points.

Then find the next trapping you want to include in the skill. If it's in a chain with the first trapping, you'll have to cross one or more lines and possibly skip over some boxes to get to it. A thin line costs 1 point to cross and a dotted line costs 2 points to cross, but crossing a thick line is free. If there's a box in the way for a trapping you don't want to add to the skill, you can skip it for free. If getting to a trapping would mean crossing four or more points' worth of lines, just pay four points plus the cost of the new trapping. For example, if you're starting with Physical Force, crossing the three thin lines and one dotted line between it and Dexterity would only cost 4 skill points, not 5. Likewise, skipping the trappings in between -- Leap, Move, and Skulk -- wouldn't cost anything. Crossing the same line multiple times doesn't cost additional points.

If the additional trapping isn't chained to a trapping the skill already has, you'll just pay for the trapping itself. For example, adding the Languages trapping to a skill always costs only 1 point.

The only exceptions are with Unique skills. If you're building a Unique skill, the Information and Networking trappings are free to add. You'll still have to pay for crossing lines in the chain, if any, but the trappings themselves are complimentary.

Extras increase this total; Drawbacks reduce it. See
Extras and Drawbacks for details.

Add up all the skill points you've spent on lines and boxes, then subtract any discounts from Drawbacks. That's the Unique or Strange skill's total cost.

For example, let's say you're creating a Unique skill rated at Good (+3) called Oxford Professor, with the following trappings:  Information,  Research,  Languages,  Wealth, Esteem, and Networking. This means that you can use Oxford Professor to be well-educated, know how to use a library, speak multiple languages, draw an income, defend your public reputation, and leverage your Oxford connections to your advantage. Looking at the Skill Trapping Diagram, you decide to start with Networking. It's chained to Wealth by a thin line, which will cost 1 point to cross, and Wealth has a solid border, which will cost 1 point to add. It's the same story with Esteem: 1 point to cross the thin
line, and another point to add it to the skill. Languages isn't connected to anything, so it'll only cost 1 point to
add. Information is free to add, since this is a Unique skill, but it's connected to Research (a solid box) by a thin line, so crossing to and adding it will cost 2 more points. So far that's a total of 6 skill points (not including Networking, which, like Information, is free to add). To reduce the cost a bit, you choose to throw in a Minor Complication aspect of "Too Smart for His Own Good," which lowers the skill point cost for the trappings down to 5. Adding that to the skill's rating of Good (+3) gives you a total of cost you 8 points: 6 + 3 - 1 = 8.

There's only one universal restriction on how Unique and Strange skills are built: All trappings in the skill must fit the skill's theme. No exceptions.

> ## Skill Trapping Diagram
> \[TODO\]

> **How to Use This:** Pick a trapping for the skill to use as a starting point, and pay skill points to add it to the skill. Follow the lines to get to other trappings. The more lines you have to cross to get to the next trapping, the more expensive it is. A thin line costs 1 skill point to cross, a dotted line costs 2 skill points, and a thick line costs no points. A trapping with a solid border costs 1 point to add to a skill, while one with a dotted border costs 2 points to add. If adding a trapping would mean spending 4 or more skill points on crossing lines, it only costs 4 points to get there, plus the cost of adding the trapping itself (e. g., to go from Physical Force to Dexterity costs 4 points, but you still have to pay another point to actually add Dexterity to the skill). If a trapping isn't connected by lines to any other trappings already in the skill, it doesn't cost anything extra to add. For example, Languages and Environment always only cost 1 point each, regardless of what other trappings the skill already has. Add the skill rating and apply Extras and Drawbacks for the total cost.

## Power Tier and Refresh
The skill's Power Tier reduces your Refresh, as indicated below.

* Mundane Tier: -0 Refresh
* Extraordinary Tier: -1 Refresh
* Superhuman Tier: -2 Refresh
* Ascendant Tier: -4 Refresh
* Godlike Tier: -6 Refresh

Again, if the skill doesn't derive from a character's Strangeness, it can't exceed the Extraordinary Tier.

Returning to the Oxford Professor example above, let's make the character one of the greatest professors in the annals of Oxford's long and storied history. Instead of a Mundane Tier skill, it's now an Extraordinary Tier skill (-1 Refresh). Assuming the game is set in the Middle Century, the character's Refresh would be reduced from its default starting value of 8 down to 7.

Let's try a Strange skill now. Maybe our bespectacled academic also happens to have the strength of a hundred men, with a bulletproof body to match. Judging by the trapping summaries, this sounds like Physical Force, Resist Damage, and Stress Capacity \[Health\]. On the diagram, we'll start with Resist Damage, for 2 skill points. That's chained to Stress Capacity \[Health\] by a thin line, which means 1 point to cross; Stress Capacity \[Health\] has a dotted border, so it'll cost another 2 points to add. So far we're at 5 skill points. Crossing the dotted line to Physical Force costs 2 points, and then adding it costs one more, so our new total is 8 skill points.

We need a Drawback to go with that. Maybe accessing this ability means the good professor has transform from his usual 11 stone to a massive brute -- that sounds fun. We give him a Drawback of Minor Transform, which lowers the cost of the skill by 1 point (it also means he has to replace one of his aspects with something more appropriate when he transforms, like swapping out "Respected Oxford Professor" for "Terrifying Hulking Brute"). Add to that the skill's rating of Good (+3), and the total skill point cost is 10. To make his strength and toughness truly impressive, we spend 2 Refresh to put that skill in the Superhuman Tier.

Invulnerabilities and Weaknesses also affect your Refresh:

* Minor Invulnerability \[NarrowCategory\]: -1 Refresh
* Major Invulnerability \[Narrow Category\]: -2 Refresh
* Minor Invulnerability \[Broad Category\]: -2 Refresh
* Major Invulnerability \[Broad Category\]: -4 Refresh
* Minor Weakness: +1 Refresh
* Major Weakness: +2 Refresh

Skill Summary

1. What do you want the skill to do? This is the skill's theme.
2. Does the skill represent some sort of supernatural power?
* Yes: It's a Strange skill. Continue to step 3.
* No: It's not a Strange skill. Continue to step 3.
3. Is what you want the skill to do adequately represented by a common skill?
* Yes: Just use the common skill instead of building one. Skip to step 5.
* No: You'll build a skill from scratch. Continue to step 4.
4. Go to the Skill Trapping Diagram. Follow the instructions given earlier to add trappings to the skill.
* Every trapping you add to the skill must be appropriate to its theme.
* If it's a Unique skill, Information and Networking are free to add (except for crossing lines).
5. Apply Extras to the skill's trappings, as desired.
* Extras increase the skill's cost.
6. Apply Drawbacks to the skill, as desired.
* Drawbacks decrease the skill's cost. The minimum cost of a skill is its rating.
* Every Strange skill has to have at least one Drawback. (See step 8.)
* Common skills in the Mundane Tier cannot have Drawbacks.
* Unique skills in the Extraordinary Tier or above must have either a Conviction aspect or a Complication aspect. This is optional for Unique skills in the Mundane Tier. (See step 8.)
7. Determine the new total cost of the skill and pay skill points for it.
8. Set the skill's Power Tier and pay Refresh for it accordingly.
* If the skill's Power Tier is Superhuman or higher, it's automatically a Strange skill. Go back to step 6, if necessary.
* If it's a Strange skill, the Power Tier can be as high as Godlike.
* If it's a Unique skill, the Power Tier can  be  either  Mundane  or Extraordinary.

> ## One Unique Skill vs. Three Common Skills
> When considering whether or not to create a Unique
skill for your character, you may run the numbers and come to the conclusion that it'd be cheaper to take a few common skills -- and get more trappings in the bargain. You're certainly welcome to go that route, but first take the following practical considerations into account:

> 1. If you aren't able to take all of those common skills at the same skill rating, not all of them will be rated as high as you might like. With a Unique skill, you'll be equally effective with all the trappings you wanted in the first place.
> 2. If you want those skills to be in the Extraordinary Tier (see below), it'll cost you 3 Refresh. With a single Unique skill, it'll only cost 1 Refresh.
> 3. Run those numbers again -- remember, Unique skills get Networking and Information cheap.
> 4. Perhaps most importantly, it's more fun to say "I'm rolling Archbishop of York" than "I'm rolling Bureaucracy."

## Trapping Descriptions


The trappings listed below are in the following format:

### NAME
Description and rules.

**Theme:** The trapping must be appropriate to this theme.

Tier Benefits: Special benefits available if the skill's Power Tier is above Mundane. A single skill can confer a number of these, chosen when the skill's Power Tier is purchased, equal to its skill rating.

### CLIMB 
Use Climb to determine how quickly or well a character can navigate movement on a vertical surface. However, not every encounter with a wall, tree, or fence is going to necessitate a skill roll. If failure isn't interesting, don't bother: Either the character can climb it, if that's what would make the story more interesting, or he can't, if it's just impossible.

Generally speaking, physical barriers are fairly meaningless, story-wise, unless another conflict is imminent (or ongoing). The barrier itself should be something that complicates the scene, but usually shouldn't be its focus. Instead of requiring a skill roll, assign the barrier a border value to increase the cost of passing from one zone (the bottom) to another (the top). If the border value is equal to or less than the rating of the skill with this trapping, the character can cross it freely. Otherwise, the character takes the difference as a penalty to his next action.

For example, a character needs to climb a wall to disable a ticking time-bomb on the roof. The character's Athletic skill (which includes the Climb trapping) is Good (+3), while the border value of the wall is 4. This means the character will take a -1 penalty to his bomb-disabling skill roll.

In the event that a roll is necessary -- that is, if failing to make the climb would be just as interesting as making it -- then the base difficult depends on the height of the climb. This is further complicated by factors such as visibility, slipperiness, and distractions, which penalize the roll.

## Climbing Modifiers
| Mod |    Slipperiness   |   Visibility   |   Distractions  |
| --- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
|  -1 | Wet, slick        | Darkness, rain | Non-threatening |
|  -2 | Completely smooth | Pitch black    | Threatening     |

These modifiers are cumulative by category. For example, climbing a 15' wall (+2 difficulty) at night (-1) in the rain (-1) while being shot at from below (-2) would have a total difficulty of Fair (+2) but a penalty of -4 to the roll. The interesting consequence of failure here, obviously, would be having to engage with those unpleasant gunmen below.

Shifts can also be spent to climb faster at a rate of 1 shift per step on the Time Table (see Time and Space), to a maximum of 4 steps.

**Theme:** Movement or athleticism.

|  Height |   Difficulty   |      Notes       |
| ------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Short   | Fair (+2)      | 10’ to 20’       |
| Medium  | Great (+4)     | 20’ to 40’       |
| Long    | Great (+4) (E) | 40’ to 100’      |
| Extreme | Great (+4) (S) | Is that a house? |

### CONVERSATION   
The Conversation trapping covers friendly social interaction, especially if that interaction involves making a good impression on someone else. It's also the "default" social trapping, for those times when whatever the player's trying to do doesn't fall neatly into any other trapping. The primary function of Conversation is to make a good first impression on someone else, improve their attitude toward you, or gain a temporary social advantage over them with an aspect maneuver.

By default, an NPC's initial reaction toward a character will be mildly negative, neutral, or mildly positive. Stronger attitudes, such as love, hate, friendliness, respect, and so on, generally result from deeper, pre-existing knowledge of the character, and are unlikely to change dramatically in a first meeting. If the GM's uncertain about which of these applies, roll a Fate die: - for mildly negative, 0 for neutral, and + for mildly positive.

If the player doesn't want to accept this reaction roll, she can attempt to turn on the charm and improve upon it. Make an opposed skill roll; if the rating of the NPC's relevant skill is unknown, it defaults to Mediocre. A successful roll in either the character's favor or the NPC's favor adjusts the NPC's attitude; successful with style adjusts it even further, as shown below.

Hostile: The NPC actively wants to harm the character, physically, socially, or otherwise.

Negative: The NPC is suspicious of the character and will not help him.

Neutral: If offered an incentive, the NPC can be convinced to help the character.

Positive: The NPC will go slightly out of his way to help the character. With incentive, the NPC may risk himself to help in a passive manner, such as "forgetting" to have the character sign in, turning a blind eye at an important moment, or the like.

Friendly: The NPC will inconvenience himself to help the character. With incentive, the NPC may risk himself to help in an active manner, such as distracting a pursuer, discreetly slipping the character a sought-after key, and so on.

Aspect: The winner gets to declare a sticky aspect on the NPC to emphasize his super-Friendly or ultra-Hostile attitude, as appropriate.

It's important to consider the potential consequences of an NPC's reactions to characters. Maybe they'll give them a little extra help that could translate into a bonus on a skill check, or maybe, if their reaction is Hostile, they'll turn up later as an enemy -- possibly a significant one.

**Theme:** Social prowess, deception, persuasion, diplomacy.

### CONVINCE
A skill with the Convince trapping can be used to talk someone else into (or out of) taking action. This is essentially a Mental conflict, but it shouldn't be a poor man's mind control (though with the Psychic Extra, it can be used for actual mind control; see the Psychic Extra description for details). With a solid argument or proper incentive, a person can be convinced to do something they might do anyway, but successful use of the skill can't make someone, say, leap off a cliff to their death, or give the character all of their worldly possessions, or suddenly turn on their master after a lifetime of unwaveringly loyal servitude. However, convincing someone to talk instead of fight, to part with a few pounds, or grant you an audience with the Queen are all within reason, given the right circumstances.

The skill can be used as part of a quick contest to sway the opinion of a minor NPC, or an extended contest, complete with Composure stress and Mental consequences, until one party acquiesces by being Taken Out or making a concession. If the contest is actually two parties trying to influence a third party, such as a public debate, it could be an extended contest (see the Doing Things section in Chapter 7: Running The Game). It's up to the GM and players to frame the conflict in whatever way makes the most sense.

Compare this trapping with both Conversation and Guile. If the skill is about being well-liked and making friends everywhere you go, take the Conversation trapping. If it's about tricking people into liking or believing you based on half-truths (or worse), the Guile trapping is your best bet. But if the skill's theme involves being diplomatic or persuasive, use this trapping.

**Theme:** Force of personality, diplomacy, articulate speech.

|                  | Character's Favor  ||        NPC's Favor        ||
| Initial Attitude | Success  |   Style   |     Success      |   Style  |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| Hostile          | Negative | Neutral  | --               | Aspect  |
| Negative         | Neutral  | Positive | Hostile          | Aspect  |
| Neutral          | Positive | Friendly | Negative         | Hostile |
| Positive         | Friendly | Aspect   | Neutral | Negative |
| Friendly         | --       | Aspect   | --               | --      |

### CRAFT+
With this trapping, the skill can be used to create permanent, physical works consistent with the skill's theme. This includes building mechanical devices, painting portraits, writing poetry, constructing a violin, and any other task whose end result is the creation of something new. Most of the time, this is something that requires the proper tools, materials, and time more than it does a skill roll, simply because sitting around in a workshop or studio creating stuff generally lacks tension and conflict. You set that workshop on fire, though, or surround that studio with two-dozen angry Frenchmen, and it's a whole other story.

"The proper tools and materials" usually means having access to a proper facility (see the Workspace trapping). The rating of the facility needed is based on the quality of the work to be created or the cost of its materials (see the Wealth trapping), as appropriate to the work. For example, crafting an intricate piece of Strange technology like an electro-static discharge cannon would be an expensive endeavor requiring costly tools and materials, so the quality of the Workspace would be commensurate with its cost. Composing a soul-shattering poem, however, has no appreciable cost in materials, so the difficulty would be judged according to its desired quality (which, one would hope, would be high). A character who needs but lacks a sufficient facility to complete his work must either acquire one or borrow one from someone else.

The default time required is A Day (see the Time Table in Time and Space, page 318), plus a number of steps up on the Time Table equal to the device's quality. If the rating of the skill with this trapping is less than the device's quality, increase the time required by +1 step on the Time Table for every point of difference.

Of course, this process can be sped up with a skill roll, at a rate of 1 step on the Time Table per shift spent, to a maximum of 4 steps for 4 shifts.

Technological devices present some special challenges. Unless the device is a Strange skill with the Focus Flaw (see Extras and Drawbacks, page 230), its quality is equal to twice the number of its improvements; see the Equipment Gift.

The quality of a device represented by a skill is equal to the skill's total cost in skill points (skill rating plus total trapping value, less Drawbacks), and its Power Tier is the same as the skill's. For example, crafting a Fair (+2) Personal Aero-Platform (E) with the Move trapping (1 point), an Extra of Unusual: Flight (+1 point), and the Minor Focus Drawback (-1 point) would be a task with a Good (+3) difficulty (2 + 1 + 1 - 1) in the Extraordinary Tier, which would require an Extraordinary Tier Workspace to attempt.

If the device is represented by multiple skills, make a separate roll for each one. For example, creating a suit of steam-powered armor represented by the Strange skills Good (+3) Exoskeleton (S) (4 points in trappings) and Fair (+2) Wings (E) (3 points in trappings) would be a task requiring two skill rolls: one with a difficulty of Epic (+7) (S) and another with a difficulty of Superb (+5) (E).

Improvements made to an existing device generally don't last from session to session, so if you want to start play with a device, make it a Strange skill with the Focus Flaw, or buy one or more Equipment Gifts to reflect it. With that in mind, if the pacing of the game is such that the players have time to hang out in a workshop for a few days, that's probably a sign that the threat facing them isn't urgent enough.

When taking this trapping to represent artistic ability, consider whether the Inspire trapping would be more accurate. If the primary function of works you want to create is to impress onlookers, readers, or listeners, Inspire is probably a better choice. This trapping is best for artistic works whose utility goes beyond aesthetics, such as a clever forgery of a "lost" Michelangelo.

If the skill is in the Extraordinary Tier or above, it can be used, along with a sufficient Workspace (if appropriate), to craft works of the same Power Tier. The character must pay Fate Points equal to the Power Tier's Refresh cost -- 1 Fate Point for an Extraordinary Tier work, 2 for a Superhuman Tier work, and so on -- in addition to whatever Fate Points the character might spend on invoking aspects as part of the crafting process. If the work comprises multiple skills, the Fate Point cost must be paid for each skill's Power Tier separately. These works last for the duration of the story or until destroyed or dismantled.

**Theme:** Any sort of creativity, such as artistic or mechanical aptitude.

**Extraordinary Tier:** Once per story, the player may spend a Fate Point to have the character spontaneously reveal a previously undisclosed work appropriate to the skill's theme or add an improvement to an existing piece of equipment for one scene. Treat this work as a piece of Equipment with two improvements (see Gifts, page 244).

**Superhuman Tier:** Once per session, the player may spend a Fate Point to give the character a theme-appropriate work (a piece of Equipment with two improvements, as above) or add two improvements to an existing piece of Equipment that last for one scene.

**Ascendant Tier:** The player may spend a Fate Point once per session to give the character a theme-appropriate work (a piece of equipment with three improvements) or add two improvements to an existing piece of Equipment that last for the rest of the session.

> Attention, Control Freaks
> You may notice there's no trapping called Control or Manipulate Elements or anything like that. So how do you make your fire-control guy? It's simple: Most "control" functions are just messing with aspects, and any skill can be used for an aspect declaration or maneuver. Want to create fire? Use your Fire Control skill to declare an aspect of "On Fire." Want to make it bigger? An aspect maneuver will turn "On Fire" into "Raging Inferno." Want to put it out? Another aspect maneuver will remove it altogether. Mind control works similarly; see the Psychic
Extra description for details.

### DEXTERITY+
A skill with the Dexterity trapping reflects the character's ability to pick pockets, palm small objects, perform magic tricks, and do nearly anything else that requires fine manual control. This makes Dexterity a pretty broad trapping, but enough of its applications are similar that it's just easier to collect them all under the same umbrella.

Attempting to pick a target's pocket, or steal something from the target without being noticed by the target, is an opposed skill roll. You suffer a -2 penalty on this roll.

Most other applications of Dexterity will entail rolling the skill, with the result setting the difficulty for an onlooker's skill roll to see where the key went, how the card trick works, what you did with his pocket watch, and so on.

**Theme:** Subterfuge, thievery, coordination.

**Extraordinary Tier (or better):** You may pay a Fate Point to use the Dexterity trapping of this skill as a free action.

### DISGUISE+
A skill with the Disguise trapping lets the character appear to be someone other than herself. Use this skill in an opposed roll (usually using the Examine trapping) against any active attempts to penetrate the disguise. The extent of this trapping's effects is dependent upon what props are available, and won't normally hold up to intense scrutiny using investigation. In these cases, obtaining shifts on the opposing skill roll mean that the attempt at Disguise has failed. This takes time, though -- generally a few minutes by default, and only once per scene. Casual inspection uses the Notice trapping against a target number equal to this skill's rating, but can be attempted as a free action once per scene.

Disguises generally hold up until the worst possible moment. The trick when dealing with disguises is less about when the opposition wins a roll and more about when the opposition is going to get close enough, and for long enough, to take a closer look with the Examine trapping. That's the trump card, and the way to play out tension in a scene with disguises is by making it clear such a roll may be lying in wait.

If the character is disguised as a particular person, the GM may assign some hefty bonuses (+1 to +4) to an attempt to penetrate the disguise by someone who actually knows the person he appears to be.

If it's appropriate to the skill's theme, this trapping can instead be applied to things other than people, such as disguising a machine as some other sort of machine, or creating an illusion out of thin air. See the Range and Unusual descriptions in Extras, page 230.

**Theme:** Deception, illusion, social artistry.

**Extraordinary Tier:** When disguised as someone else, you gain an additional aspect to represent the veracity of your performance. If the disguise isn't of anyone in particular -- for example, a policeman, tradesman, or some other face in the crowd -- choose an appropriate aspect that might be obvious to a casual onlooker. If the disguise is of a specific subject, and you've successfully assessed one of the subject's aspects, you gain that aspect (or one of them, if you've assessed more than one of their aspects) as long as you're disguised.

**Superhuman Tier:** As Extraordinary Tier, except you gain as many as two aspects.

**Ascendant Tier:** As Extraordinary Tier, except you gain as many as three aspects.

**Godlike Tier:** As Extraordinary Tier, except you gain as many as four aspects.

### DISMANTLE
The opposite of the Craft trapping, the Dismantle trapping allows a skill to be used to "unmake" mechanical or technological devices. Given time and tools, the skill can also topple virtually any building or structure. In those circumstances, the character can use this trapping to deal damage to the target. By default, a device has 2 Health stress boxes; modify this by its quality as if it were a skill with the Stress Capacity trapping. A device "defends" against attacks using either its quality or the appropriate skill used by whoever is holding it, in the highest applicable Power Tier. See the Focus Flaw for more on this.

The Dismantle trapping can also be used to make assessments or declarations (see Aspects) about a device or structure. These can be offensive or defensive, depending on what the character is trying to accomplish. An especially
well-built or unusually designed device or structure can mean an increased difficulty number.

Indirect attacks against people are also possible, such as setting up a bridge to collapse when someone walks across it (in which case the targets take damage from the resulting fall -- see Falling in Chapter 7: Running The Game). Large or complex devices or structures, such as buildings or safes, are more accurately treated as consequential or extended contests (see Chapter 7), especially if such a task is the focus of a scene, session, or story.

All  of  the  above  applies  to  a relatively  methodical  approach  to destroying inanimate objects. For a quicker, brute-force approach, see the Physical Force trapping.

**Theme:** Mechanical aptitude.

### DODGE
The skill offers defense against any physical attack, whether a punch, a sword, or a bullet.

**Theme:** Movement or perception.

### ENVIRONMENT \[TYPE\]
A skill with the Environment trapping can be used to navigate and survive in the specified type of environment. Types can vary widely, but the most common are Wilderness (generally a temperate wilderness), for outdoorsy types, and Urban, for your average street urchin. As a Strange skill, the limits are even broader --  things like Environment (Space) and Environment (Subterranean) aren't out of the question.

The skill is typically rolled against a difficulty number set by the GM to forage for food, hunt game, withstand hostile conditions, or scrounge for useful items such as herbs or the cast-off detritus of an uncaring metropolitan society. The difficulty for finding something is based off how likely it is to be found and how interesting it will be to use. The base likelihood depends on the environment and what's being looked for.

| Difficulty | Likelihood |                                    Example                                    |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| +0         | Likely     | Wood or vine in a forest, a discarded crust of bread in the streets of London |
| +3         | Possible   | Strong wood in a swamp, a shilling in the street                              |
| +5         | Unlikely   | Wood in a desert, a secret cache of liquor behind a loose brick               |
| Add'l +1   | --         | Each additional search criterion                                              |
[Each qualifying criterion increases the difficulty by +1.]

Thus, if a character needs sticks in a forest, the difficulty is Mediocre (+0), but if he needs sticks of a certain size and strength (two criteria) the difficulty is Fair (+2). Trying to build something in the environment, like a trap, is a use of the Craft trapping, but is modified by this skill.

**Theme:** Expertise in, experience with, or knowledge of the chosen environment.

**Extraordinary Tier:** The chosen Environment may be any type found on Earth that stretches the bounds of reality, such as the Earth's core or the Lost World of Roraima.

**Superhuman Tier (or better):** The chosen Environment may be completely disconnected from Earth altogether, such as Mars, outer space, or an alternate plane of existence.

### ESTEEM 
The skill defends against social attacks, from slanderous rumors to embarrassing truths.

**Theme:** Popularity, standing in society.

### EXAMINE
Examine is the trapping of sustained, intense study of a place, person, or thing. When searching for something specific, the difficulty of the skill roll should be kept at Mediocre (+0), with the shifts on the result being used as a yardstick for how long it takes to find the thing. The only exception to this is if the GM has a reason the thing in question shouldn't be found. In those situations, it's often better to just make the thing unfindable due to a critical missing piece that would "unlock" access to the otherwise unfindable objective. In these cases, don't even bother with the roll -- rather, the GM should just put the character on the path to discovering that missing piece. This missing piece could be equipment, like a key, or the utterance of a magic password. Once that's in place, the difficulty should drop back to the usual level.

If characters are just searching an area for clues, the guidelines for Notice apply. Set the base difficulty at Mediocre (+0), and make sure that characters can find something. Once they do, the burden is on the GM to make sure that whatever they find suggests a distinct course of action.

As the GM, when in doubt about how difficult a piece of information should be to find, aim low. The players' failure to find a clue should never derail the game. It may seem like it makes life less interesting if there is no challenge in the skill roll, but this is one of those odd situations where that is not the case. A lack of information is clearly frustrating to players, and if you have a player who really savors the challenge of figuring out clues, the challenge is usually less in finding the clues than in figuring out what they mean once they're found. And there's the rub: Clues don't come with explanations baked right in. Position your mystery in the clues they find, not in the clues they don't. Remember, unless there's something actually there to be found, no roll is necessary.

The specifics of how this trapping works is highly dependent on context and the skill's theme. Regardless, a skill with the Examine trapping is especially well-suited to making declarations appropriate to its theme. For example, as part of a skill themed around detective work, the character could assert minor details about a crime scene, then back them up with a successful roll. Similarly, as part of a skill with an outdoor-survival theme, Examine could be used to track footprints. As a trapping in a skill called Mental Telepathy, it could be used in an opposed roll to read the subject's surface thoughts. And so on.

**Theme:** Sensory or extra-sensory perception.

### GUILE 
Use the Guile trapping to tell lies without getting caught. For simple deceptions, such as bluffing one's way past a guard, a simple opposed skill roll is all that is necessary. For deeper deceptions, like convincing someone of something they believe to be false, a mental conflict is appropriate, complete with attacks and Mental consequences that reflect the falsehood the target now believes.

Even the most persuasive lie can only suggest a course of action, not compel one. At best, a character can suggest that a given course of action is in the target's best interest, but even if that's convincing, some people still won't take the bait if it violates their convictions. A skill with this trapping should never create behavior that is at odds with the basic nature of the target -- an honest
man won't be tricked into stealing, for example, though he may be tricked into holding stolen goods if he has no reason to think they're stolen.

A successful lie puts the target in a position where his own nature forces the decision that the liar wanted him to make. Mechanically, this works by compelling or tagging the associated consequence. A pacifist won't kill, unless he feels he has to do so to protect something more important than his pacifism. As such, a skill with the Insight trapping is a natural complement to a skill with this trapping, to give the character an idea of how to spin things.

In any case, this is not a huge problem when the Guile trapping is used on NPCs, though under no circumstances should it become a poor man's mind control. When player characters are taken out by a Guile attack, however, it's important to remember that though they may believe something false to be true now, it should not change their essential nature.

**Theme:** Deception, subterfuge, social artistry.

### HIDE+
A skill with the Hide trapping is one of not being seen. When a character is hiding, she's remaining perfectly still and (hopefully) out of sight. Lighting, obstacles, and other environmental factors can affect the player's roll, and the result of the skill roll is the difficulty for the searcher to find her (using a skill with either the Notice trapping or the Examine trapping). When someone is searching you can usually assume they'll do logical things like turn on the lights and check behind the curtains. Assuming such action is possible, the searcher receives a +2 bonus to his skill roll. This means that if a stealthy character is ever in a position where people are actively searching for her, she's in a lot of trouble. That usually requires that the character was spotted or somehow set off an alarm -- which, if she's doing her job, she wasn't, and didn't.

For example, consider a character hiding in a storeroom. If a guard opens the door, shines a lantern in, and looks around, it's just a quick skill roll (reason, perhaps, but not time), and the character can probably stay hidden. If the guard brings in several other lantern-bearing guards and they all start methodically going through the room, hiding is much, much more difficult -- they've imposed some penalties, and they have both reason and time.

The good news is that this sort of searching is usually obvious, so when the guards start looking, it's the player's cue to act now or give up her chance at surprise.

Environmental conditions can have a significant effect on a character's ability to hide and remain hidden, as shown on the table below.

| Mod. |                      Environment                      |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
|   +4 | Pitch black, no visibility                            |
|   +2 | Darkness, smoke, thick fog, no clear line of sight    |
|   +1 | Noisy distractions                                    |
|   +0 | Dim lighting, cluttered line of sight, moderate noise |
|   -1 | Complete silence                                      |
|   -2 | Good lighting, clear line of sight                    |
|   -4 | Bright lighting, clear area                           |

If you're not certain how to handle something, treat it as a half step. For example, if a character is hiding in the dark from guards holding torches, reduce the bonus to only +1.

**Theme:** Stealth, subterfuge, environmental familiarity.

**Extraordinary Tier:** Normally, moving and Hiding don't mix, but if the skill is in this Tier the character may move 1
additional zone without automatically giving herself away.

**Superhuman Tier (or better):** The character may move any number of zones without affecting her ability to remain unseen.

### INFLUENCE
Putting the Influence trapping on a skill enables it to be used for public attacks on a person's character -- slander, libel, and all other modes of reputation-ruining. Influence attacks deal Reputation stress and Social consequences.

In some respects, this trapping is very similar to the Networking trapping, in that both make use of rumors, gossip, and public perception to accomplish something. However, while Networking can be used to gather information and declare details and aspects, a skill with the Influence trapping is the character's ability to leverage her social connections to directly harm someone else's public image.

**Theme:** Social influence, status.

### INFORMATION
This trapping lets the character answer questions related to the skill's theme. Sometimes this will mean making a skill roll to see how much information the GM is able to impart, but having the skill at all means the character is at least relatively well-versed enough in the subject matter to know something. For example, the Academics skill has this trapping, which lets a character use it to learn information that could be gained from a formal education; a Unique skill called Underworld with this trapping could be used to gain information about people, places, things, or events related to the Under Class.

When setting a difficulty for a Knowledge roll, the best yardstick is the obscurity of the knowledge sought as it relates to the relevant circle of society (i.e., if Academics, the circle will be scholars; in the case of the Underworld example above, the circle would be the Under Class).

**Theme:** Anything related to academia, the intellect, any sort of science, expertise, or formal education.

|        Difficulty        |                         Degree of Obscurity                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mediocre (+0)            | Common knowledge ("The Tower Gang are criminals.")                   |
| Average (+1)             | Widespread knowledge ("The Tower Gang are all Strangers.")           |
| Fair (+2)                | Specialized knowledge ("Big Hand and Little Hand are related.")      |
| Good (+3)                | Esoteric knowledge ("Ben Bell is smarter than he looks.")            |
| Great (+4)               | Very esoteric knowledge ("Little Hand is really Big Hand's sister.") |
| Fantastic (+6)           | Secret knowledge ("Ben Bell is the real brains of the Tower Gang.")  |
| Legendary (+8) (E)       | Private knowledge (The origins of each member of the Tower Gang.)    |
| Divine (+10) (S) or more | Lost knowledge (The true face of The Face.)                          |

Note that despite these suggested difficulties and examples, if the GM decides that a piece of information simply can't be known, because it was never recorded or for whatever reason, not even a Divine (+10) Academics effort can uncover it. That's what adventures are for.

> ## Wait, What's to Stop Me From Gaming This System?
> Not a thing. If you want to produce the most effective character for the least number of points, then inventing a Unique or Strange skill with a vaguely broad theme and stuffing it with as many trappings as possible -- or just 20 Variable trappings -- is a good way to do it.
> 
> The goals of this system are threefold. First, it's intended to let you get exactly the character you want to play by letting you define the precise areas of expertise, influence, and experience your character has. Second, it is intended to make skills and mundane experiences really, really interesting. Superpowers are fantastic, but leading your own cult, knowing how to mix herbal remedies, or holding public office can be fantastic, too. Finally, it's intended to allow you to indulge your creativity in the same way that aspects do. Even with no Strange skills at all, this system should allow you to really put your mark on a character.

> And what kind of boor would want to spoil such a marvelous bit of starry-eyed game-design idealism? Not you, I say!

### INITIATIVE \[SCOPE\] 
A skill with the Initiative trapping is used to determine order of actions in a conflict of the appropriate scope. When this trapping is purchased, choose one scope: Physical, Mental, or Social.

The highest-Tier skill with the Initiative trapping automatically acts first in a conflict of its scope. For example, if the conflict involves three characters with Initiative trappings in the Mundane Tier and one with an Initiative trapping in the Superhuman Tier, the Superhuman-Tier character will act first. In the case of multiple characters with an Initiative-trapping skill in the same Tier, make an opposed skill roll between them to determine who acts first.

**Theme:** Sensory or extra-sensory perception of the appropriate scope.

### INSIGHT+ 
Adding Insight to a skill lets the character use it to assess another character's aspects. This is an opposed roll vs. the Willpower trapping. Before the roll, the "attacker" states what sort of aspect she's looking for, usually by subject matter (an emotion, a relationship, the character's past, etc.). If the "attacker" gets 2 shifts or fewer, she learns an aspect of the defender's choice. If she gets 3 shifts or more, she learns the aspect that most closely matches the information she seeks. This process usually takes about Half an Hour (see the Time Table in Time and Space, page 318); by spending excess shifts, the character can reduce the time required at a rate of 1 step per shift spent (to a minimum of One Minute).

**Theme:** Social prowess, psychic ability.

Extraordinary Tier (or above): Mental attacks that would benefit from this skill's Insight trapping deal additional Composure stress -- Weapon 1 \[Composure\] at Extraordinary Tier, Weapon 2 \[Composure\] at Superhuman Tier, and so on. This skill and the skill used to attack must be thematically related to receive this benefit. For example, a character with Empathy (S) would deal +2 Composure stress when using Intimidation.

### INSPIRE
With this trapping, the skill can be used to have an emotional effect on a group of listeners. Examples include an actor delivering a soliloquy, a commander barking a speech at his troops before battle, and a satirical poet performing in Hyde Park. With a successful roll, the character can declare a scene aspect limited to the mood and emotional impact of his speech. The difficulty of the task starts at Good (+3) by default, and certain existing circumstances can act as penalties to the skill roll, as indicated on the table below.

These penalties are cumulative, so trying to change the mood of two armies engaged in a pitched battle would carry a total penalty of -8 to the skill roll.

An aspect put on a scene using the Inspire trapping describes its general mood, which is important to keep in mind for more than just invocations and compels. For instance, if the mood of a scene is "Somber," then that's likely to have a general effect on NPC behavior, just like a scene with a "Dark" aspect would obscure vision.

It's also worth remembering that the mood of a group offers a secondary opportunity for compels and other complications. If the mood of the room is somber, and a player fails to act in accordance with the mood, others will probably respond badly to them -- for example, reading The Illustrated Police News during a funeral. This is one of the few instances when it might be reasonable to compel a character using a scene aspect instead of a character aspect.

**Theme:** Performance, wit, speechifying.

|    Circumstance    |                                                                      Notes                                                                      | Mod. |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Existing mood      | The room has an existing mood, and you're trying to add another.                                                                                |   -1 |
| Changing a mood    | The room has an existing mood, and you're trying to change it (either by design, or because it's actively contradictory to the desired mood). |   -3 |
| Distractions       | A noisy room or other activities that make it hard to focus on the performance.                                                                 |   -1 |
| Major Distractions | A large, active area with many distractions that requires active effort to pay attention to the performance, such as a busy marketplace.        |   -3 |
| Total Distractions | There's no reason for anyone to be paying attention to the performance, such as on a battlefield.                                               |   -5 |

### LANGUAGES+  
The character knows a number of languages (in addition to his own) equal to the skill's rating. These languages can be currently spoken, such as German or Mongolian, or dead languages, such as Sanskrit or spoken Archaic Egyptian. Normally, these languages must be from Earth, but if it suits the character's background more "exotic" languages can be chosen instead. For example, the Lost Jupiterian, from Jupiter, knows Jupiterian. The player can decide on these all at once, or define them as needed during the course of play.

**Theme:** Intellect, formal education, or general wordliness. 

**Extraordinary Tier:** The character knows an additional five languages as described above. These can be defined
during play or chosen in advance.

**Superhuman Tier:** As the Extraordinary Tier, plus a number of "exotic" languages, such as High Aklo, Atlantean, or Venusian, equal to the skill rating.

**Ascendant Tier:** The character knows all languages used on Earth, mortal or otherwise, living or dead, plus a number of exotic languages equal to the skill rating. In addition, the character may spend a Fate Point to add any language which she could've reasonably encountered to her list of known languages.

**Godlike Tier:** As Ascendant Tier, plus the character may spend a Fate Point to add any language to her list of known languages, even if there's no way she could've ever encountered it before.

### LEAP+
A skill with the Leap trapping can be used to determine how far the character can jump. For most characters, of course, this is closely associated with the Move trapping, but it's been split off here to account for characters whose jumping prowess has nothing to do with how quickly they can cover ground. For example, a super-strong character might not be able to sprint quickly, but his prodigious muscles might enable him to leap Big Ben in a single bound.

Adjudicating such leaps, though, is an odd proposition. The act of jumping itself should be a complication to some other task, not the focus itself. Generally speaking, whether a jump "succeeds" should not be a binary pass/fail affair, unless there's an interesting consequence attached to failure. "Plummeting to one's death" doesn't really fall in that category -- immediate, unforgiving death-by-dumb luck isn't especially interesting for the player or the story. Instead, it often makes more sense to assign that pit, chasm, or cliff a high border value to increase the cost of passing from one zone (this side) to another (that side). If the border value is equal to or less than the rating of the skill with this trapping, the character can cross it freely. Otherwise, the character takes the difference as a penalty to her next action. See Time and Space, page 318, for more on zones and border values.

For example, let's say the character wants to jump from one rooftop to another to flying-kick her quarry. Her Athletics skill (which includes the Leap trapping) is +3, but the border value between her zone (one rooftop) and her enemy's (the other rooftop) is 4. Instead of rolling Athletics to see if she can jump, she just takes an additional -1 to her attack once she gets there.

Alternately, a "failed" skill roll can be interpreted as the character's sudden realization that she just can't jump that far, so she doesn't even attempt it. In this case, a failure just means having to find another way to the other side, especially if that's where the story is.

Naturally, it's entirely possible that there's something worth seeing at the bottom of that pit, in which case it makes total sense to roll. Here, you're rolling to see which of two possibilities the character encounters: Do they leap across the alley, or do they fall through the secret trapdoor in the street below?

**Theme:** Movement, athleticism, or physical strength.

**Extraordinary Tier (or better):** The character's ability to Leap is so impressive that he can cover great distances in the blink of an eye. For each Power Tier above Mundane, the character can move 1 zone as a Free Action, or ignore the equivalent border value between zones (border value of 1 at Extraordinary, 2 at Superhuman, etc.).

### MENACE
The Menace trapping covers mental attacks, such as fear or intimidation. This is usually done as an opposed skill roll (versus a skill with the Willpower trapping). However, these things don't occur in a vacuum -- the target must have a reason to believe that the character is capable of harming them. If this isn't the case, and the attacker is outnumbered, imprisoned, bound to a chair, or at a similar disadvantage, the defender receives a +2 bonus to his skill roll.

As an attack, successful use of the Menace trapping inflicts Composure stress and Mental consequences. The trapping can also be used to perform an aspect maneuver on the defender.

**Theme:** Fear, intimidation, appropriate brands of social prowess.

### MINIONS+
A skill with this trapping can be used to call forth allies of some kind -- functionaries, bodyguards, supernatural entities, or whatever else is appropriate to the skill's theme. By default, these allies must contacted by ordinary means, such as a messenger or a telegram, and arrive under their own power by conventional means. In some cases, this may preclude their arrival altogether, such as if you're trapped in a prison with no way to contact the outside world. To alter any of these parameters, take the Unusual Extra, once for each alteration (see Extras and Drawbacks). With a Fate Point and proper justification, the Minions can arrive more quickly than would otherwise be considered reasonable. Perhaps your operatives were already on the scene, blending with the crowd until needed, or maybe that crate over there just happens to contain a half-dozen of your Automechanical Arachnoids, waiting to be shipped out. Regardless, Minions cannot be called more than once per scene, and the allies generated by it disperse or disappear, as appropriate, once the scene is through.

Roll the skill against a difficulty of Mediocre (+0), and spend the shifts obtained to produce your Minions. An Average-quality Minion ally costs 1 shift, a Fair-quality Minion ally costs 3 shifts, and a Good-quality Minion ally costs 5 shifts. All Minions must be of the same quality.

For 2 skill points, you get Simple Minions. Instead of giving them skills, simply assign scopes, Physical, Mental, or Social, according to their intended purpose within the scene. Treat the scope as a broad skill that covers a variety of mundane functions. An Average Minion has one scope at +1, a Fair Minion has one scope at +2 and one scope at +1, and a Good Minion has one scope at +3, one at +2, and one at +1. For twice the cost, 4 skill points, the character can call on Advanced Minions. These Minions can have full skill pyramids of one, three, or six skills: one Average (+1) skill for Average-quality Minions, two Average (+1) skills and one Fair (+2) skill for Fair-quality Minions, and so on, using skills instead of scopes. Advanced Minions are more customizable, but also require more attention from the player to implement.

See Playing the Opposition in Chapter 7: Running the Game for more information on Minions.

Minions cannot take consequences -- once their stress track is exceeded, they're Taken Out. For a specific ally, such as an assistant or valet, use the Companion Gift (see Gifts).

A specialized form of this trapping, Duplicates, can be used to create clones or identical copies of oneself. See the sidebar for details.

**Theme:** Authority within an organization, social connections, sorcery.

**Superhuman Tier:** By rolling the skill against a difficulty of Mediocre (+0) (S), one of the Minions' scopes or skills can be upgraded to the Extraordinary Tier.

**Ascendant Tier:** As Superhuman Tier, but roll against a difficulty of Mediocre (+0) (A) to upgrade one of the Minions' scopes or skills to the Superhuman Tier, or two scopes or skills to the Extraordinary Tier.

**Godlike Tier:** As Superhuman Tier, but roll against a difficulty of Mediocre (+0) (G) to upgrade one of the Minions' scopes or skills to the Ascendant Tier, one scope or skill to the Superhuman Tier and one other to the Extraordinary Tier, or three scopes or skills to the Extraordinary Tier.

> ## Duplicates
> This is a specialized form of the Minions trapping, one that can only be used to create copies of the character. The duplicates arrive instantly, however they're created; for "slower" duplicates, take a Flaw to that effect. Roll the skill against a difficulty of Mediocre (+0), and spend shifts obtained to create duplicates. An Average-quality duplicate costs 1 shift, a Fair-quality duplicate costs 3 shifts, and a Good-quality duplicate costs 5 shifts. All duplicates must be of the same quality. The duplicates have one skill per rating available, as per their quality (for example, a Fair duplicate has one +2 skill and one +1 skill). Only Strange skills can have this trapping, and no duplicate can have a skill with the Duplicates trapping.
> 
> A duplicate's skills are limited to those belonging to the character, and no duplicate can have a skill rated higher than the character's equivalent skill. For duplicates that are radically different from the character, such as past and future versions of the same person, or duplicates called forth from alternate dimensions, use the Minions trapping instead.
> 
> **Theme:** Duplication, super-mitosis, space-time control.

### MOVE+
Use Move to determine how quickly or well a character can cover ground. By default, the mode of movement is walking or running. To change that to some other, weirder form of movement -- flying, tunneling, etc. -- use the Unusual Extra (see Extras and Drawbacks). Under normal circumstances, a character can move 1 zone as a supplemental action. See the Climb and Leap trappings for details on negotiating border values between zones.

Alternately, the skill can reflect the character's ability to operate a vehicle, such as a carriage, aero ship, tractor carriage, or automotive, or ride an animal, such as a horse or camel. Though these modes of transport obviously offer some advantages over walking or running, they're balanced (more or less) by the fact that they require specialized, expensive equipment, and/or animals, to use. A character who takes the Move trapping as part of such a skill automatically has (or has access to) an appropriate vehicle, as long as that vehicle's cost (see Money, page 72) is equal to or less than the skill's rating.

**Theme:** Movement, obviously -- although how that movement  is  achieved, whether via muscle power or telekinetic flight or a vehicle, is wide open.

**Extraordinary Tier (or better):** The character's ability to Move is so impressive that he can cover great distances in the blink of an eye. For each Power Tier above Mundane, the character can move 1 zone as a Free Action (1 zone at Extraordinary, 2 at Superhuman, etc.).

### NETWORKING+
With the Networking trapping, the skill can be used to take advantage of a character's social contacts for the purposes of gathering information and spreading rumors. The extent of this, however, is limited by the character's aspects. Before rolling the skill, the player must cite (but not invoke) an aspect related to his social contacts. At the bare minimum, every character should be able to cite his Social Class aspect to rely on people he may know in his immediate social circle, or the World aspect "Malum Necessarium" to rely on other members of the Kerberos Club (assuming the character in question is a Kerberan). The aspect chosen will color the information received and limit its extent. For example, using this trapping with the Working Class aspect is unlikely to be useful (or at least reliable) if attempting to learn information or rumors about the aristocracy. In a way, Networking is the social equivalent of the Information trapping.

The process begins with a question -- say, "Who's trying to kill me?" The player then describes where her character is going to talk to folks (usually "the street" or "the local tavern" or something else appropriate to the cited aspect), the GM sets the difficulty, and the player rolls her skill. If the skill roll fails, then the player can retroactively improve her roll by taking more time (see the Time Table, page 318). This takes an afternoon by default, and a +1 can be added to the roll for every additional step taken on the Time Table, up to +4 for four steps.

Regardless, a successful roll should always result in a clear course of action. If the character is being "shut out" for one reason or another, no amount of dogged persistence through time investment is going to help. When that happens, it usually means there's another problem the character needs to solve first.

Note that being the most informed guy and knowing all the latest gossip aren't necessarily one and the same.

Networking finds out what people know -- and people always have their own biases and misconceptions. It rarely indicates the veracity of the information provided, save by the discovery that contradictory answers are coming from different sources. If a character wants to separate truth from lies, that's a more in-depth conversation, and may involve other skills.

Networking also keeps the character apprised of the general state of things, and acts as a sort of social Notice. It's far from foolproof, and the GM is usually the one to call for a roll. A player can't generally go out looking for a tip off, though he can tell the GM he's going out talking to his contacts "just to check" on what's up, which is a good hint that he'd like a tip off. If the resulting skill roll is at least a +0, the character
catches wind of an interesting rumor. At +3, and every two shifts over that, the character learns an additional rumor, or more information on a previous rumor. For example, at +0 the character may learn that some upper-class toff has been asking questions about him; at +3, the character may also learn that the toff in question had a strong German accent.

This trapping is also useful for planting rumors in addition to ferreting them out. The player simply tells the GM what rumor he wants to plant and rolls the skill with the Networking trapping. If the subject of the rumor is a person, it's an opposed roll between the rumor-spreader and the target. If the subject of the rumor is something more general, such as "I hear the beer at the Ten Bells is poisonous," then the GM can use the standard declaration rules (see Aspects).

The pervasiveness of the rumor depends on how many shifts are obtained on the roll, according to the table below.

The final effort is also the target for someone else's Networking roll to find out who's been spreading rumors, refute a rumor, or replace a rumor with another. When a player plants a rumor, the GM should consider it a mental bookmark. Assuming anything but a terrible roll, that rumor should resurface later in the game. What form it takes depends on the player's roll.

**Theme:** Social connections or politics, as per at least one of the character's aspects.

Extraordinary Tier (or above): Social attacks that would benefit from this skill's Networking trapping deal additional Reputation stress -- Weapon 1 \[Reputation\] at
Extraordinary Tier, Weapon 2 \[Reputation\] at Superhuman Tier, and so on. This skill and the skill used to attack must be thematically related to receive this benefit. For example, a character with Contacting (S) would deal +2 Reputation stress when using a skill with the Influence trapping.

| Shifts Obtained | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 0-2             | The rumor earns passing mention (a fragile aspect).                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| 8+              | The rumor has spawned a number of alternate or embellished versions as well, all with the same thread running through them. Additional shifts may be used to speed up the rate at which the rumor spreads or help conceal who started it in the first place. |

### NOTICE+
This trapping measures the character's passive level of perception. This includes spotting things without actively looking for them, such as a concealed door, an easily missed clue, or an assassin about to strike. (If the character is actively looking for something, use the Examine trapping.) The GM usually sets a difficulty for the Notice roll, and should provide an additional piece of information for every two shifts achieved. Whenever ambushed (see the Hide and Skulk trappings), a character may make one last Notice roll opposed by the attacker's Hide or Skulk trapping, whichever is appropriate, to see if he's actually surprised. If the roll succeeds, the character may use a skill to defend, with a -2 penalty on
the roll. If the Notice roll fails, the character's defense is +0.

**Theme:** Sensory or extra-sensory perception.

**Extraordinary Tier (or better):** The character's senses are so keen that she can defend normally even when surprised.

### PARRY
The skill offers defense against hand-to-hand attacks.

**Theme:** Fighting ability, defense, or perception.

### PHYSICAL FORCE+
The skill measures the character's ability to exert physical force on an object. The source could be sheer muscle power, an exo-skeletal suit of armor, telekinesis, or whatever else makes sense with the skill's theme.

Characters have a default amount of weight they can lift or carry. Find the Power Tier of the skill with Physical Force, then compare that to the skill's rating. That's the maximum the character can lift and carefully handle or, if the skill's theme is related to the character's actual physical capability, move slowly with. If purely lifting without moving, treat the skill as if it were 2 steps higher. A character carrying something 4 steps below their listed maximum can move freely, but suffers a -1 to all physical actions for every weight increment over that. If the weight of the object is listed in a Tier below that of the character's skill, it can be carried freely and without penalty. If aided by equipment such as a pulley system, the character's Physical Force can be improved by as much as one Tier, at the GM's discretion.

This may seem like an awfully numbers-heavy approach for a game that generally shies away from such things, but when it comes to character strength, people generally like to have benchmarks. Plus, the weight a character can lift is a pretty accessible way to get a feel for how strong they are. At a +0 difficulty, a character can lift a medium-sized adult in the Mundane Tier, a large Siberian tiger in the Extraordinary Tier, a killer whale in the Superhuman Tier, a brachiosaurus -- one of Her Majesty's, perhaps --  in the Ascendant Tier, and a paddle-wheel steamship
in the Godlike Tier. (Obviously, things get a little ridiculous for Physical Force in the Godlike Tier, but that's why it's called Godlike.)

To determine how far a character can throw something (or someone), roll your Physical Force against the rating (in the left-most column of the table below) of the object's weight. Successfully throwing the object 1 zone requires spending 1 shift plus a number of shifts equal to the object's Weight Factor (WF). The WF of a row remains the same regardless of the Tier. In other words, a 400-pound object has a WF of 3, as does a 1,500-pound object and a 32-ton object. (The difference is that throwing an object of a lower Tier lets the player swap out Fate dice for d6s.) Every additional zone costs as many shifts as the previous one did, plus one, so it gets progressively harder to throw an object multiple zones. In no case can a character lift, carry, or throw an object whose weight is above the maximum for the skill's Tier.

If throwing an object whose weight is in the Mundane column using a skill whose Power Tier is higher than Mundane, treat it as if you were rolling against an opponent's Mundane skill.

For example, a character with Good (+3) Physical Force (Mundane) can lift and carry a 50-pound object without penalty, or a medium-sized adult (150 pounds) at a -1 penalty to his physical actions. He can lift and stagger around with a 300-pound object at a -4 penalty to physical actions, and if he's just lifting something without moving (for instance, lifting a heavy gate), his maximum lift is 400 pounds, but he can't maintain that for long. He can try to lift something heavier by making a Physical Force roll, but under no circumstances can he even attempt to lift something heavier than 800 pounds unaided. If he wanted to throw a 50-pound sack of flour 2 zones, he'd need to make a Physical Force roll against a difficulty of -1 and get at least 4 shifts (1 for the object's weight, +1 for the first zone, and +2 for the second zone) -- a total of +3.

If the character's Physical Force were instead Good (+3) (E), carrying 400 pounds would be only a -1 penalty to his physical actions. Throwing that sack of flour two zones would still require at least a +3, but now he gets to roll 3dF+1d6 instead of just 4dF. Needless to say, if he wants to throw it a little farther, odds are good that he can do it.

**Theme:** Strength or physicality. If a Strange skill, themes like psychic ability or elemental control are also options.

Extraordinary Tier (or above): Physical attacks, armed or unarmed, that would benefit from this skill's Physical Force trapping have Weapon 1 per Tier over Mundane --  Weapon 1 \[Health\] at Extraordinary Tier, Weapon 2 \[Health\] at Superhuman Tier, and so on. This skill and the skill used to attack must be thematically related to receive this benefit. For example, a character with Brawn (S) would deal +2 Health stress when using Fisticuffs, but not Firearms or Strange skills such as Telekinesis or Earth Control.

### REPAIR
A skill with the Repair trapping can be used to fix mechanical devices, given the right tools and enough time. For devices with stress tracks, the difficulty is equal to the quality of the device. It takes a Few Hours to remove stress or a Mild consequence, a Day for a Moderate consequence, and a Week for a Severe consequence. For devices that don't have stress tracks or consequences, the difficulty is based on the monetary value of the device (see the Wealth trapping) or its quality (see the Craft trapping), whichever is higher.

Failure on a repair roll can be made up in a few ways, retroactively. First, each additional step longer  on the Time Table (page 318) gives a retroactive +1 to the player's roll, up to a maximum of +4 for four steps on the table. Second, the device can be repaired within the usual timeframe, but the quality drops by one for every point shy of the target. Both methods may be combined; for example, a character can get a retroactive +3 to take two steps longer and drop the quality of the item by one. Degradation in item quality may mean that some of its special abilities are lost, if it has any. Subsequent efforts may be made to restore the item to its original quality, but those face a difficulty equal to the target quality, +1 for every two steps the current quality is below the target. Missing a restoration roll can only be made up by investing time, and the starting length of time on such efforts is usually a week.

If the GM agrees to it, a player may make a partial repair when falling just short of the target. In these cases, the consequence on the device being repaired is downgraded in severity, rather than being entirely removed. If the character misses the roll by one, he may opt to downgrade the consequence, regardless of its severity, to Mild.
If the character misses the roll by two, he may opt to downgrade the consequence one step, taking Severe to Moderate and Moderate to Mild. If the consequence is Mild in any of these cases, it is removed, but the device's appropriate stress track is filled.

Given a sufficient Workspace, the skill can be used to Repair devices whose Power Tier is at or below its own. For example, a Superhuman Tier skill with this trapping could fix Extraordinary or Superhuman Tier devices.

**Theme:** Mechanical aptitude.

### RESEARCH
Used in conjunction with Information, this trapping lets the character take advantage of an appropriate Workspace, such as a library or laboratory, to aid in a skill roll to learn about the topic at hand. Where Information represents immediately accessible knowledge stored in the character's head, Research is knowledge gained from a more methodical approach. To use Research, take the margin of failure on an unsuccessful Information roll. This is the number of steps up on the Time Table (page 318) the character may take to turn that failure into a success. It's up to the GM to determine the default time required to conduct Research, but a good rule of thumb is Half an Hour.

The maximum obscurity of the information that can be obtained from a Workspace trapping is equal to its quality. See the Workspace trapping for more detail.

**Theme:** Anything related to academia, the intellect, any sort of science, expertise, or formal education.

### RESIST DAMAGE  
The Resist Damage trapping allows the skill to be used to defend against a physical attack not by avoiding the blow, but by being tough enough to just take it. However, this is only effective if the attacker's intent is to deal Health stress to the defender. Otherwise, treat the skill as if it had a rating +0 in the Mundane Tier. For example, if the attacker throws a dart at the defender, Resist Damage can be used to negate taking damage from the hit, but not to avoid the hit. If the dart actually conceals a homing beacon or a hallucinogenic poison, this trapping will not prevent the dart from finding its mark, or the poison from taking effect.

**Theme:** Physical toughness or strength.

### SECURITY
The Security trapping is used to overcome or evaluate security systems, such as locks, tripwire alarms, or a deadfall trigged by a spring-loaded pressure plate. If multiple obstacles of this nature are encountered in the course of an infiltration attempt, all of them can be rolled into a single skill roll, or, if the infiltration itself is an important part of the story, they can each be treated individually, requiring a series of skill rolls to defeat. The difficulty of any such roll can be estimated according to the table below, or set by the skill roll of whoever set up the security measures in the first place, as the GM desires.

Most security measures require tools of some kind to disable, from ordinary lockpicks to more exotic implements for sophisticated safes or mechanical traps. Improvised tools, such as picking a lock with a bent piece of found wire, imposes a -2 penalty. Lacking any such tools doubles that penalty to -4, assuming the task can even be attempted at all.

As a rule of thumb, the default time required to defeat a Fair (+2) security measure is Half an Hour (see the Time Table, page 318), stepped up or down depending on the difficulty of the task. For example, the default time required to pick a lock of Average (+1) difficulty would be 15 Minutes, while cracking a safe of Good (+3) difficulty would default to An Hour. Shifts obtained on the roll can be spent to speed the process up at a rate of one step down on the Time Table per shift spent, to a maximum of 4 steps. Likewise, a failed roll can be mitigated by taking more time than the default, to a maximum for +4 to the result for 4 steps up on the Time Table.

The Security trapping is a good one to use for declarations and assessments when casing a potential target or anticipating the strengths or weaknesses of a security system.

**Theme:** Crime or law enforcement.

|   Difficulty  |                     Example                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Mediocre (+0) | A locked desk drawer, a petty thief's repository |
| Average (+1)  | A securely-locked working-class home             |
| Fair (+2)     | The door of a middle-class shopkeeper            |
Good (+3) | The door of a jail cell |
Great (+4) | The front door of an MP, a typical safe |
| Fantastic (+6) | The safe of an upper-class home, the front door of the Kerberos Club |
| Legendary (+8) | The vault of Queen Victoria's treasury |

### SHOOT  
As Strike, but with the advantage of range -- by default, the skill can be used against targets one zone away. For more distant attacks, use the Range Extra (see Extras and Drawbacks).

**Theme:** Offense.

### SKULK
This trapping has a great deal in common with the Hide trapping, but is concerned with remaining silent while moving instead of remaining out of sight while stationary. Otherwise, the rules and modifiers presented in that trapping's description all apply here.

**Theme:** Stealth, subterfuge, environmental familiarity.

### STRESS CAPACITY \[SCOPE\]+
The Stress Capacity trapping modifies one of a character's stress tracks. Pick one when this trapping is chosen: Stress Capacity \[Health\], Stress Capacity \[Composure\], or Stress Capacity \[Reputation\]. The effect of the trapping depends on the rating of the skill: one additional stress box if the skill's rating is Average (+1), two additional boxes if it's Fair (+2) or Good (+3), and three more boxes if the skill's rating is Great (+4).

A skill with this trapping can also act as a limiting skill for long-term activity within its scope. See Chapter 7: Running The Game for more on limiting, modifying, and complementary skills.

**Theme:** Toughness, hardiness, or resilience appropriate to the scope of the trapping.

**Extraordinary Tier:** The skill provides Armor 1 for the chosen scope.

**Superhuman Tier:** The skill provides Armor 2 for the chosen scope. Additionally, the character can withstand an additional Mild consequence of the chosen scope.

**Ascendant Tier:** The skill provides Armor 3 for the
chosen scope. Moreover, the character can withstand an additional Mild consequence of the chosen scope, and once per scene the character may clear a Mild Consequence of the chosen scope as a free action.

**Godlike Tier:** As Ascendant Tier, but the skill provides Armor 4 for the chosen scope. The character also receives one additional Moderate Consequence slot of the chosen scope.

### STRIKE
The skill can be used to cause physical harm to others in a manner consistent with its theme. For example, as part of the Common skill Arms, the Strike trapping is used to attack with weaponry, while as part of the Fists Common skill it's about slugging your foe with your bare mitts. Strike can only be used against individuals in the same zone as the character. For ranged offense, see Shoot.

**Theme:** Offense.

### TRANSPORT   
A skill with this trapping is used to operate a mode of transportation, such as a horse, carriage, boat, or airship. The exact form of transportation this applies to depends on the skill's theme, but in general it should fall into one (and only one) of five broad categories: animal riding, animalpowered ground transportation, mechanical ground transportation, watercraft, or aircraft.

Normally, the skill only needs to be rolled when taking a risk, such as driving at top speed through a crowded street, engaging in a chase, attempting a dangerous maneuver, running someone down, and so on. Otherwise, merely having a rated skill with this trapping is enough for competent, safe operation.

When a skill roll is required, however, it's generally made in conjunction with one of the animal's or vehicle's skills, such as Gallop or Handling. If rolling against a static difficulty number, look at each skill roll individually. If both succeed, the action is a success. If only the character's roll succeeds, the animal or vehicle takes Health stress equal to its margin of failure. If both rolls fail, things are bad; see About the Town, About the Globe on page 97 for more detailed information.

When using this skill to cover ground, a successful roll only indicates safe operation. Use the animal or vehicle's roll to determine how many zones are moved. No matter how good the rider, driver, or pilot, an animal or vehicle can only move as fast as it can move. To simulate pushing beyond its normal limits, put an aspect on the animal or vehicle using an aspect maneuver.

In a conflict, this trapping can be used to both attack and defend, although the animal's or vehicle's skills may have an effect as well, as described in About the Town, About the Globe.

**Theme:** Animal riding, vehicle operation.

### TREATMENT \[SCOPE\]+
Treatment is the trapping of making things better -- the "meat" version of the Repair trapping. Depending on the scope chosen, the skill can be used in a medical capacity to treat injury, disease, poison, and so forth (the Physical scope), or it can be used to alleviate fear and restore confidence (the Mental scope), or repair a damaged reputation (the Social scope). In game terms, this means clearing stress boxes and consequences.

The difficulty involved depends on the severity of the situation. To clear stress boxes, roll this skill against a difficulty equal to the highest stress box filled; for every 2 shifts obtained, clear one stress box. Removing a Mild consequence has a difficulty of Fair (+2). Reducing (not removing) a Moderate consequence to Mild, assuming the "patient" has a Mild consequence slot to spare, has a difficulty of Great (+4). If this roll succeeds with style, the consequence is removed altogether. Severe consequences cannot be removed with Treatment -- only time.

This trapping should generally represent a "downtime" use of the skill, as opposed to something the character can do in the heat of the moment or the press of battle. Clearing stress and Mild consequences is the exception to this -- think of it as the first aid equivalent of the chosen scope -- but this cannot be attempted more than once per character per scene.

Treating a Moderate consequence may, depending on circumstance, require a Workspace, or at least the proper environment. For example, removing a Moderate Physical consequence may necessitate medical equipment, while a couple hours down at the local may be just the thing to clear a Moderate Mental consequence.

**Theme:** Varies widely, depending on the chosen scope, but in general the theme should be able to comfortably cover reducing trauma or injury in yourself or others.

**Extraordinary Tier:** Ordinarily, attempting to reduce or remove a Moderate consequence is something that has to take place outside of a conflict situation. For you, this is not the case. If the consequence is within the scope of this trapping, you may make a roll against an Extraordinary Tier target of Great (+4). On a success, the consequence is reduced to Mild (assuming the character has an open Mild consequence slot of the appropriate scope). If the roll succeeds with style, the consequence is removed altogether.

**Superhuman Tier:** As Extraordinary Tier, plus you can also attempt to clear a Severe consequence within the trapping's scope. If it's a Physical consequence, the patient's body must be intact. Make a skill roll against a Superhuman Tier target of Fantastic (+6). On a success, the consequence is reduced one degree of severity, and on a success with style it's reduced by two degrees of severity. Regardless, the patient must immediately change one of his Personal aspects to reflect the indelible mark the trauma has left on him.

**Ascendant Tier:** As Superhuman Tier, except you can also reattach limbs, restore organs, and the like if the trapping's scope is Physical. Make a skill roll against an Ascendant Tier target of Legendary (+8). On a success, the consequence is reduced one degree of severity, and on success with style it's reduced by two degrees of severity. Again, the patient must still immediately change one of his Personal aspects as a reminder of the experience.

**Godlike Tier:** As Ascendant Tier, plus you can attempt to revive the dead -- that is, a character whose Taken Out condition was death. Make a skill roll against a Godlike Tier target of Divine (+10). On a success, the patient is immediately brought back to life, but must rewrite a Conviction or Complication aspect to reflect the profundity of the experience. On a failure, the patient is still dead, and another revivification cannot be attempted until sufficient time has passed. (The default is A Day, plus one step on the Time Table for every point by which the roll failed.) This process does not remove any of the patient's consequences or stress he may have had when he died. Normally, this requires that the patient's complete corpse be present (though not necessarily intact). If the GM deems the circumstances appropriate -- for example, if the character has a Godling aspect of "Goddess of Life" --  an attempt may be made without the body at a -4 penalty to the roll. Treat a success as described above, but the character's body arrives (somehow) naked as the day he was born.

### VARIABLE \[FREQUENCY\]
Some skills are just so broad that they defy precise definition, such as Profane Sorcery or Shapeshifting. For these skills, there's the Variable trapping. A Variable trapping can be used to replicate any other trapping or Extra on the fly, as decided by the player during the course of play. The specifics, however, must fit within the skill's theme. For example, a Variable trapping in a Strange skill called Psychic Constructs could be used to create a psychic sword (the Strike trapping) or shield (the Parry trapping), or even a psychic velocipede (the Move trapping). But it couldn't be used to duplicate the effects of the Conversation trapping, or the Willpower trapping, because those trappings simply don't make sense in the context of the skill's theme.

A Variable trapping that can be defined anew once per scene costs 4 skill points to add to a skill, while one that can only be defined once per session only costs 2 skill points.
When replicating another trapping or Extra, the number of skill points it would cost to add the trapping or Extra to the skill is the number of Variable trappings you'll need for the job. For example, duplicating the effects of the Shoot trapping (2 skill points) would require two Variable trappings; tacking on the Zone Extra (also 2 skill points) would require another two Variable trappings. Once a Variable trapping is committed to creating an effect, it can't be used to create anything else until the next scene or session.

Variable is not a when-in-doubt trapping -- it's a
there's-no-other-way trapping.

**Theme:** Versatility, such as shapeshifting, magic, or impressively eclectic training.

**Extraordinary Tier (or better):** If the Variable trapping is duplicating as a skill with a Tier-dependent benefit, such as Physical Force, then the Variable trapping provides that benefit as well.

### WEALTH
The Wealth trapping measures the character's available funds, whether that's a few shillings in her pocket, a chest full of crowns at home, or the family silver mine. Usually, a skill with this trapping serves to passively inform the GM about what the character has at her disposal, but may still be rolled for large expenditures, like purchases and bribes. Some large-scale conflicts may be about trying to out-spend the other guy; here, the skill can be used to attack or defend. Wealth-based attacks deal Reputation stress and Social consequences.

In terms of social class and the Wealth trapping, members of the Under Class have a Mediocre (+0) income, while the Working Class is at Average (+1), the Middle Class is at Fair (+2), and the lifestyle of the Upper Class is at least Good (+3), if not somewhere in the Extraordinary Tier.

A general guide to what things cost in the Victorian era (rated on the Adjective Ladder) can be found in the section entitled Money (page 72). A character can easily afford anything with a rating 2 steps below his skill, and anything 1 step below his skill with a minimum of fuss. Anything with a rating equal to or greater than your skill, however, will require a roll. If successful, the item is obtained; if not, it isn't. Only one such skill roll can be made per scene. Note, however, that this trapping is less about buying things than it is about leveraging your personal assets to solve problems. If the players are spending a bunch of time shopping, things aren't dangerous enough.

If knowledge of the character's wealth would affect a situation, the skill with this trapping may modify whatever other skill is being used, either positive or negative. (And if you don't believe that having a lot of money can negatively affect a situation, you've never applied for a student loan.)

**Theme:** Status, social connections, livelihood.

### WILLPOWER
Use a skill with the Willpower trapping to defend against attempts to get inside the character's head. This includes fear, intimidation, and mesmerism, and efforts to assess the character's aspects. In addition, this trapping is also used to resist supernatural attacks against the character's psyche, such as mind control.

**Theme:** Discipline, self-control, social prowess.

### WORKSPACE
Workspaces are environments where a character can perform a certain type of work, such as a library, laboratory, manufactory, mechanical workshop, and so forth. Attaching the Workspace trapping to a skill provides the character with such a facility of a quality equal to the skill's rating. This trapping isn't so much about a character's ability to use such a facility -- that's better represented by the Research, Craft, and Repair trappings -- but about his easy access to, and the utility of, such a facility. If coupled with the Wealth trapping, the workspace in question is likely owned by the character; otherwise, it's probably just one that he can reliably use.

The quality of a workspace limits the obscurity of information that can be found there (see the Information trapping), or the quality of devices that can be made or fixed there (see the Craft and Repair trappings), depending on the skill's theme. Also see the Device Flaw for more on
skills-as-equipment.

**Theme:** Academia, expertise, formal education, mechanical  or scientific aptitude, personal wealth.

**Extraordinary Tier (or better):** The workspace can be used to make, fix, or improve works equal to or less than the skill's Power Tier, and relevant to its theme. For example, an Extraordinary Tier laboratory can be used to make or repair Mundane or Extraordinary Tier scientific devices.

# Extras and Drawbacks
Trappings paint a Unique skill in broad strokes, but Extras and Drawbacks fill in the details and help bring it to life. Extras are a trapping's refinements and add to its total value.

## Extras

| ## Extras Summary Table                                                                                  |||
| Name    | Cost    | Description                                                                            |
| Psychic | +1      | The trapping operates through supernatural mental ability.                             |
| Range   | +1      | The trapping's effective range increases.                                              |
| Spray   | +1      | The trapping affects multiple targets in the same zone simultaneously.                 |
| Unusual | +1      | The trapping operates by some non-standard principle appropriate to the skill's theme. |
| Zone    | +2      | The trapping affects all targets in a zone simultaneously (and indiscriminately).      |

### Psychic (+1 skill point)
The trapping works through sheer Strange mental ability. With this Extra, Social trappings don't require any actual interaction between the character and the target as long as they're in range, and Perception trappings don't rely on ordinary human senses. For example, a clairvoyancethemed Strange skill with Examine + Psychic would ignore any penalties due to poor visibility, but still be subject to whatever "psychic" penalties due to environment or circumstance the GM might see fit to impose. (This is highly dependent on context, though: If the skill's theme were telepathy instead of clairvoyance, Examine + Psychic would let the character read minds, not view an area remotely.)

The Psychic Extra removes the need for physical exertion implicitly required by trappings such as Dismantle or Physical Force. Even a character restrained by chains and a padlock could use Security + Psychic, for example, to pick the lock and free himself. When attached to trappings like Disguise and Hide, Psychic represents a forcible change in the observer's perception as opposed to a physical transformation. Observers without "minds," such as clockwork automatons, would therefore remain unaffected.

A skill with Convince + Psychic can be used to simulate mind control. Make an aspect maneuver against the target, using the standard rules for aspect maneuvers. If successful, put an aspect like "Under My Control" on the target. Your total effort on this roll is the difficulty for the target to remove the aspect (with an aspect maneuver of their own) and break free of your control. Until then, you can invoke the aspect for effect to control the target. The first tag's free, as usual, but after that it'll cost a Fate Point each time --  paid to the target. This is expensive, of course, but no one ever said controlling minds would be easy.

It's up to the GM and player to determine what narrative effect the Psychic Extra might have as part of any other trappings. For instance, Minions + Psychic could mean servile psychokinetic constructs, or it could simply remove the need to contact your Minions by conventional means: Instead of sending a messenger, you send a telepathic message.

If one of a skill's trappings has the Psychic Extra, every trapping under that skill must also have it. In other words, a skill can't be just partially Psychic -- it's all or nothing.

EXAMPLES: Telepathy (Conversation + Psychic), Mind Reading (Insight + Psychic), Psychic Persuasion (Convince
+ Psychic), Mind Blast (Menace + Psychic), Mental Illusions (Disguise + Unusual: Illusion + Range + Psychic).

### Range (+1 skill point)
The trapping's effective range increases. If it's a trapping that normally only affects the user, like Disguise, the Range Extra turns the skill into one that affects other targets, as long as they're in the same zone as the character. If the trapping normally only affects the character who uses it, such as Disguise, it can be applied to a target within the same zone. If the trapping is normally used against other targets but has no inherent range, such as Strike, it gains a range of 1 zone. If it already has range of 1 zone or more, such as Shoot, increase its range by +2 zones. Range can be taken more than once on a single trapping.

EXAMPLES: Stretching (Physical Force + Range), Telekinesis (Physical Force + Range + Psychic), Clairvoyance (Examine
+ Range x2 + Psychic), Keen Eyesight (Notice + Range x2)

### Spray (+1 skill point)
With this Extra, a trapping can be applied against multiple targets in a single exchange. If the trapping is used offensively, roll your skill as normal, then take a penalty of -1 per target, if you have two or more targets. For example, if you have three targets and your total effort is +6, each target only has to get a +3 or better to avoid taking stress. Otherwise, spend 1 shift per additional target affected. All targets must be in the same zone.

EXAMPLES: Mystical Armor (Parry + Spray), Machine Gun (Shoot + Spray), Miniature Aero-Platforms (Move + Unusual: Flight + Spray)

### Unusual (+1 skill point)
The trapping  operates  by some non-standard principle appropriate to the theme of the skill, or gains some minor additional functionality. This is kind of a catch-all Extra for a trapping that can do a weird thing that is hard to peg down. If an effect doesn't fit neatly into any other category of Extra, make it Unusual.

The Unusual Extra can be added to a trapping to eliminate any gear or preparation it might require, such as Disguise + Unusual: Illusion to cloak the character in a magical disguise, or Craft + Unusual: Instant assembly to create a machine from its component parts without using any tools to put them together.

EXAMPLES: Shield (Parry + Unusual: Affects ranged attacks), Flight (Move + Unusual: Flight), X-Ray Vision (Examine + Unusual: Through walls), Invisibility (Hide + Unusual: Invisibility), Instantaneous Teleportation (Leap
+ Unusual: Doesn't pass through intervening space), Create Illusion (Disguise + Unusual: Illusion + Range)

### Zone (+2 skill points)
The trapping affects everyone in a zone. If used as an attack, roll your skill once; each target in the zone defends against your total effort. Otherwise, roll your skill and apply it to all targets in the zone. If the trapping doesn't work at range, it automatically affects everyone in your zone. If it would make sense for the skill to affect yourself as well, such as a swarm of clockwork locusts that attack everything in the area indiscriminately, then it does. To avoid such a fate in these circumstances, take the Unusual Extra.

EXAMPLES: Fireball (Shoot + Zone), Aero-Platform (Move
+ Unusual: Flight + Zone), Force Bubble (Resist Damage + Zone), Fear Aura (Menace + Zone)

## Drawbacks
Drawbacks come in two main categories. One is aspectrelated Drawbacks, which involve sacrificing your Free aspects in exchange for Complications and Convictions. The other is Flaws (Minor and Major), which define a skill's boundaries and can reduce its total value. Every Unique skill in the Extraordinary Tier must have an accompanying Complication or Conviction aspect, while every Strange skill (of any Power Tier) requires a Drawback of any kind. Drawbacks on a skill provide a 1-point discount if a Minor Drawback or a 2-point discount if a Major Drawback. The final cost of a skill can never be reduced below its rating. If a Drawback on a Unique or Strange skill isn't genuinely disadvantageous or doesn't fit with the skill's theme, it's not a Drawback.

| ## Drawbacks Summary Table                                                                                ||
| Aspect            | Description                                                                            |
| Complication      | A nuisance (Minor) or recurring problem (Major) in the character's life                |
| Conviction        | An additional Conviction aspect                                                        |
| Flaw  Description |                                                                                        |
| Charges           | Skill can be used a limited number of times per scene (Minor) or session (Major)       |
| Delay             | Skill takes time or effort (Minor) or both (Major) to activate                         |
| Focus             | Character needs a device (Minor), possibly breakable (Major), to use the skill         |
| Snag              | Skill's functionality is reduced occasionally (Minor) or frequently (Major)            |
| Taxing            | Player must spend a Fate Point each time the skill is used                             |
| Transform         | Skill requires a brief (Minor) or lengthy (Major) transformation before it can be used |

### Aspect: Complication (Minor or Major)
One of the character's Free aspects becomes a Complication aspect. Complications come in two degrees of severity, Minor and Major. A Minor Complication is a persistent nuisance, something that crops up now and then to cause trouble for the character. A Major Complication, however, is just what it sounds like: a serious problem in the character's life, and a source of constant struggle. When a Major Complication is compelled, the compel starts at two Fate Points.

### Aspect: Conviction (Major)
One of the character's Free aspects becomes another Conviction aspect.

### Flaw: Charges (Minor or Major)
A Strange skill with Charges can only be used a limited number of times before being replenished. Examples include a ghostly revolver, an elixir with limited doses, or a magical incantation that gradually disappears from the speaker's mind each time it's uttered. A skill with Minor Charges can be used a number of times per scene equal to its rating, so a Fair (+2) skill with the Charges Flaw could be used twice in a scene. As a Major Flaw, the skill's uses are limited per session instead of per scene. To reflect a skill that requires lengthy preparation or delays between uses, use Delay. For example, if that ghostly revolver has Minor Charges, but some sort of occult ritual is required to load it with ectoplasm first, the ritual is a form of the Delay Flaw.

### Flaw: Delay (Minor or Major)
A Strange skill with the Delay Flaw requires additional time to activate or be made available to use. This could be a technological device that needs to be charged, a potion that requires lengthy preparation before it can be consumed, or a skill that can't be used unless the character meditates for a while first. A Delay time of A Full Action/A Few Moments is a Minor Flaw. The character has to essentially lose a Turn to activating the skill, and can't take any other actions, such as using a secondary skill, in the interim. A Delay of Two Rounds/Half a Minute or longer is a Major Flaw. (See the Time Table in Time and Space.)

If the Delay requires an action that can be interrupted, such as cranking an electro-static discharge cannon, then doing so also requires the Delay to start all over again.

By default, Delay's meant for "constant" abilities that, once turned on, stay on. If the skill instead requires A Few Moments or more every time it's used, that's a Major Flaw. If it requires more than A Few Moments to Activate, and then once it's on the character still requires A Few Moments per use, that's two Activation Flaws: one to turn it on, and one for each use.

Compare this with Charges, which limits the number of times a skill can be used on a per-scene basis. Combining these two Flaws can create an ability which, for example, takes a long time to prepare, and once it's available can only be used a certain number of times, such as that electro-static discharge cannon. First it has to be cranked for A Few Minutes (a Major Delay), and then once that's been done there's only so much electro-static energy available (Major Charges).

### Flaw: Focus (Minor or Major)
The Focus Flaw means that the skill is external to the character. Without the Focus, the character can't use the skill. Taken as a Major Flaw, the skill must have an accompanying aspect, such as "Steam-Powered Armor,"  "Utility Belt," "Scientific Gadgetry," or "The Eye of Obodobo." As a Minor Flaw, Focus has no affect on the character's aspects.

### Flaw: Snag (Minor or Major)
A Snag is a limitation of some kind, although that limitation can be just about anything (as long as it's actually limiting, of course). These aren't aspects -- just boundaries around the skill's utility. For example:

* Only works during the day (Minor)
* Only works at night (Minor)
* Only works on ferrous metal (Minor)
* Only works on animals (Minor)
* Only works on gold (Major)
* Can't consciously activate (alternately, deactivate) (Major)
* No access to normal senses while using the skill (Major)
* Only works during a full moon (Major)
* Can't use any other Strange skills while this one is active (Major)
* Can't move while this skill is active (Minor for a defensive physical skill or Major for an offensive physical skill, but probably isn't worth anything otherwise)

### Flaw: Taxing (Major)
The Taxing Flaw is for a skill that requires a great investment of effort, is of limited use, or that just isn't especially reliable -- when it works, it's a big deal for the character's story. In mechanical terms, the skill requires a Fate Point to activate each time it's used. Taxing always counts as a Major Drawback.

### Flaw: Transform (Minor or Major)
A skill with this Flaw is only available to the character after he undergoes some sort of dramatic physical or mental transformation. This process takes time -- Full Action/A Few Moments for a Minor Transform, or longer for a Major Transform. Examples include drinking an elixir that turns you into a monster, metamorphosing into an animal, or manifesting an ectoplasmic aura.

Once the transformation is complete, the player replaces one of the character's Free aspects to reflect the nature of the character's change. For example, a Strange skill called Fire Giant with the Transform Flaw might replace the character's "Gregarious and Outgoing" aspect with "Towering Inferno."

Ordinarily, the Free aspect to be replaced is chosen and the replacement aspect defined when this Flaw is taken. The character always loses access to the same Free aspect and gains the same replacement aspect whenever he Transforms. The exception is if the Strange skill has the Variable trapping, in which case the player may define the replacement aspect each time the transformation occurs. If multiple Strange skills have this Flaw, they can share the same transformation, but each one replaces an additional Free aspect.

If the Transform can be interrupted or prevented, or relies on a condition that isn't fully under the character's control (such as losing one's temper in an unseemly manner), that's a Snag in addition to the Transform.

# Sample Unique Skills
Because Unique skills so often derive from a character's occupation or lifestyle, the examples provided below are organized by Social Class. In parentheses following each skill's name is its total trapping cost; add that to its rating to determine its total cost in skill points. Below that are its trappings and Extras (and the value of each), one lifestyle-appropriate Complication or Conviction aspect, and some italicized explanatory notes.

While all of these Unique skills are in the Mundane Tier, there's nothing stopping you from elevating them to the Extraordinary Tier. Also keep in mind that this is hardly an exhaustive list, nor are these the definitive versions of these Unique skills.

For a detailed treatment of these Social Classes, including example aspects for each one, see All Things Right and Proper.

## Under Class

Minor Complication (-1): Artfully Dodging the Law

You make your living on the streets, relieving others of their excess coinage, watches, silk scarves, and whatever else you can purloin when they're not paying attention. Thanks to others of your kind, you usually have a pretty good idea what the word on the street is -- and when they can't help you can probably see it coming.

### Lady of the Night (3)
Networking, Information, Conversation, Convince, Insight, Environment \[Urban\]

Conviction (-2): Whatever It Takes to Survive

The world's oldest profession is alive and well on the streets of Whitechapel. To earn your keep, you've learned to be persuasive and size up potential clientele quickly. It's a harsh life, but you aren't left with many options.

## Working Class

### Servant (2)
Networking, Information, Notice, Conversation, Insight

Minor Complication (-1): My Master's Bidding

Yours is a life of servitude. Like any good servant, you're adept at anticipating your master's needs, sometimes before he's even aware of them himself. You've also learned the fine art of sycophancy and regularly gossip with others of your station about the goings-on upstairs.

### Carpenter (4)
Networking, Information, Craft, Repair, Dismantle, Physical Force

Minor Complication (-1): A Life of Sweat and Toil

You're an adept craftsman, and your daily labors have left you with bulging muscles and a keen eye for detail. You also have connections in the Worshipful Company of Carpenters.

## Middle Class

### Physician (4)
Networking, Information, Examine, Research, Treatment \[Physical\], Workspace

Conviction (-2): The Hippocratic Oath

As a practicing physician, you know a great deal about the workings of the human body and have a proper facility at which to treat your patients.

### Barrister (4)
Networking, Information, Convince, Inspire, Insight 

Conviction (-2): My Client's Interests

Your courtroom experience makes you a persuasive speaker with a ready knowledge of the law. You're also a good judge of character, and more than capable of confounding your opposition in a debate.

### Clergyman (6)
Networking, Information, Inspire, Convince, Conversation, Treatment \[Mental\]

Conviction (-2): Doing the Lord's Work

You've given your life -- or most of it -- in service to the Church and God. You have both a strong theological education and a talent for preaching to the masses, and many in your flock come to you for counsel.

## Upper Class

### Knight of the Realm (13)
Networking, Information, Willpower, Wealth, Influence, Esteem, Stress Capacity \[Reputation\], Minions

Conviction (-2): Rule, Britannia!

You've distinguished yourself in service to the Queen -- or you've paid to make it seem as if you have. Regardless, you are a respected member of society, capable of damaging reputations and protecting your own. As part of your title, you have an estate, money, and a bevy of servants at your beck and call.

### Wealthy Socialite (17)
Networking, Information, Wealth, Influence + Spray (+1), Stress Capacity \[Reputation\], Esteem, Guile, Initiative \[Social\], Treatment \[Social\]

Minor Complication (-1): What Goes Around, Comes Around

You're among the idle rich, possessed of wealth and status but little in the way of professional ambition beyond being the center of attention at parties. Whatever gossip may be circulating in your social circles, you've either heard it first or started it yourself -- sometimes several rumors at once, if you're in the mood.

### Archbishop of York (26)
Networking, Information, Influence, Inspire, Minions, Wealth, Initiative \[Social\], Initiative \[Mental\], Esteem, Stress Capacity \[Reputation\], Stress Capacity \[Composure\], Willpower

Minor Complication (-1): A Trail of Enemies in my Wake

For you, the clergy long ago stopped being about serving God. As an Archbishop, you wield impressive political power and command a personal retinue of underlings. Your status enables you to make or break careers with a few carefully chosen words to the right people while remaining above the fray yourself.

# Sample Strange Skills
The Strange skills below are organized by Archetype. As with the example Unique skills, these are merely illustrations of a few Strange skills that may be appropriate for any given Archetype. Obviously, there's a lot of room for your own ideas, and few of the skills listed below are necessarily exclusive to the Archetype under which they appear.

Unlike the Unique skills, each of these Strange skills includes a Power Tier, but only to provide an example. None of these Tiers is mandatory in the slightest.

For a detailed treatment of these Archetypes, including example aspects for each one, see Archetypes.

# Gifts
Gifts represent areas of special training, talent, or similar capability within the purview of a single skill. Mechanically speaking, this is reflected by a small bonus or a bit of rulesbending in the character's favor. Described below are the six different types of Gifts, each of which costs 1 Refresh to buy.

Every character starts with one Gift for free.

|    Gift Name     |                                 Description                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Companion        | A "helper" NPC loyal to the character.                                       |
| Equipment        | Important or special gear of some kind.                                      |
| Impact           | Declare an aspect with the skill for free on a roll that succeeds with style. |
| Signature Aspect | One aspect can be invoked once per scene for free.                           |
| Skilled          | +5 skill points.                                                             |
| Theme            | A variety of circumstantial benefits spread among three connected skills.    |

## Companion
The character has a sidekick, valet, personal secretary, manservant, clockwork butler, fetch, or some other "helper" character. The Companion defaults to Average (+1) quality, with one Average (+1) skill, 2 stress boxes in each stress track, and one Mild consequence. A Companion requires the expenditure of a Fate Point to act alone. Otherwise, he or she attaches to the character as a Minion would, and provides the character with a +1 bonus to any skills the two share in common. In addition, each Companion automatically comes with three improvements, chosen from the list below. Unless otherwise indicated, an improvement can be taken more than once for the same Companion.

Every time this Gift is taken, it can be used to either create a new Companion or provide another three improvements to any existing Companions.

* Aspect: The Companion gains an aspect (but no Fate Points).
* Quality: Increase the Companion's quality by +1, to a maximum of Good (+3). A Fair (+2) Companion has one Average (+1) skill, one Fair (+2) skill, 3 boxes in one stress track and 2 boxes in the other two, and a Good (+3) Companion has one Average (+1) skill, one Fair (+2) skill, one Good (+3) skill, and 3 boxes in each stress track.
* Communication: The character and the Companion have a special mode of communication in keeping with their capabilities. This could be a portable wireless telegraph, a high-powered magnesium Aldus lamp projected into the night sky, a psychic link, or whatever else is within reason for the character. Attempts to break this communication link between the two are made against a difficulty of 2 + the Companion's quality.
* Independent: The Companion can act on their own without needing to spend a Fate Point, unless the Companion's sent off on a mission of significant story importance (comparable with something a PC might do, for example). While the Companion is so separated, they have access to the main character's Fate Points and two of their aspects relevant to their bond.
* Keeping Up: If the main character has some unusual form of locomotion, the Companion can somehow follow along without getting left behind.
* Skilled: The Companion gains 3 skill points. None of a Companion's skill ratings can exceed his or her quality.
* Gifted: The Companion gains one of the following Gifts: Equipment, Impact, or Theme. This improvement can't be taken more than twice per Companion.
* Empowered: Upgrade the Power Tier of one of the Companion's skills. The Companion receives Tier Benefits from this skill the same way characters do. Empowered counts as two improvements.
* Numerous: Each time this improvement is taken, the main character gains one additional Companion.
* Summonable: The Companion can show up at the main character's beck and call without needing to resort to conventional means. This takes One Minute (see the Time Table in Time and Space) by default; for a Fate Point, the Companion arrives in An Instant. The Companion automatically vanishes at the end of the scene.

> ## Gifts and Flaws
> As an optional rule for those groups who want a little more nuance in their Gifts, you can apply certain Drawbacks to Companion and Equipment Gifts to represent allies or gear that can sometimes hinder as much as they help. Maybe that doorman's gambling debts make him susceptible to bribes, or those fancy range-finding goggles of yours seem to work only when they feel like it.
> Whereas a Drawback on a skill reduces its cost by one or two points, if this option is used, a Minor or Major Drawback on a Companion or Equipment Gift provides an additional improvement.
> Applying a Complication aspect to a Companion or piece of Equipment adds an aspect to it, but one with a predominantly negative or troublesome slant. Conviction and Weakness Drawbacks, however, are too character-specific to be applied to something as external as Companions or Equipment.
> Snags are great for limiting the usual scope of Companions or Equipment, such as mail armor that doesn't offer  protection  against  firearms or a sidekick who doesn't speak English. Delay and Taxing can be suitable for many types of Equipment, but usually don't make much sense when it comes to Companions.
> Most other Flaws don't work quite as well and probably shouldn't be applied to Companions or Equipment (and it should go without saying that the Focus Flaw can't be applied to Equipment), but the ultimate call on that is up to the GM and your group. GMs should carefully consider whether to use this optional rule. It's great for certain situations, but is potentially open to abuse as well.

## Equipment
The character has an important or special piece of mundane (or mostly mundane) equipment. When this Gift is taken, the piece of equipment gains three of the following improvements. Every time this Gift is taken, it can be used to either create a new piece of equipment or provide another three improvements to any existing equipment.

* Aspect: The piece of equipment gains an aspect (but no Fate Points).
* Deadly: The equipment acts as a Weapon 1 for one type of stress (Health, Composure, or Reputation). This bonus can't do more than double the stress dealt by an attack. For example, if a weapon with Weapon 2 is used for an attack that succeeds by 1 shift, the attack does 2 stress, not 3. This improvement can be taken up to three times on a single piece of equipment, providing a maximum of Weapon 3. Only the highest Weapon value from any one piece of equipment can apply at a time.
* Well-Made: The equipment grants a +1 bonus to one skill relevant to its operation, chosen when this improvement is taken. This counts as two improvements, and can only be taken a maximum of three times on a single piece of equipment.
* Empowered: The equipment artificially boosts the Power Tier of one skill. Examples include an enchanted sword that lets its wielder fight as if his Arms skill were in the Supernatural Tier, or a brainwave-enhancing skullcap that gives anyone who wears it Extraordinary Tier Academics. If the character's skill is already in a higher Power Tier, use either his own Power Tier or the equipment's, whichever is higher. (In other words, multiple Power Tiers don't "stack.") Each step above the Mundane Tier counts as four improvements.
* Alternate Use: The equipment lets the wielder use one skill in place of another in limited circumstances.
* Protective: The equipment grants Armor 1 against one type of stress (Health, Composure, or Reputation) in a manner appropriate to the Equipment. This improvement can be taken up to three times on a single piece of equipment, providing a maximum of Armor 3. Only the highest Armor value from any one piece of equipment can apply at a time.
* Rugged: The equipment adds one stress box to one of the owner's stress tracks (Health, Composure, or Reputation). This improvement can only be taken a maximum of three times on a single piece of equipment. In order to take this improvement, the equipment must be a suit of armor or some similarly protective item. Only the highest Rugged value from any one piece of equipment can apply at a time to any one stress track.
* Numerous: Each time this improvement is taken, it gives the character a duplicate of a previously defined piece of equipment.
* Essential: The equipment lets the owner take an additional Mild consequence, usually Physical. This improvement can't be taken more than twice on the same piece of equipment. In order to take this improvement, the equipment must be a suit of armor or some similarly protective item. Having multiple pieces of equipment with this improvement does not increase this benefit.

> ## Skill, Equipment, or Aspect?
> As you can see, there are basically three ways to represent a gadget using these rules: as a Strange skill, as an Equipment Gift, or simply as an aspect. So which is the right one to use? Any of them, really -- it just depends on what you want to do.
> If it's a Wonder -- some truly remarkable bit of gear like mechanical wings -- or a supernatural artifact of some kind, make it a Strange skill. That'll give you the power and versatility to make something truly remarkable and/or outlandish.
> If it's an exceptional but otherwise mundane item that's conceivably possible to create in the non-Strange world, it's probably best to make it an Equipment Gift. As an Equipment Gift, it won't give you any new abilities, really. It'll just make you better at things you can already do.
> Or you can skip these routes entirely and just make it one of your personal aspects. For example, if you have an aspect of "My Father's Cavalry Sabre" to represent a family heirloom, you could invoke it when fencing, schmoozing with one of your father's old cavalry buddies, cutting a tough rope, or anything else where it might come in handy. But it would exist only in narrative terms -- you'd have to spend a Fate Point to get any use out of it.
> Probably the best option is to make your gadget either a Strange skill or an Equipment Gift, and devote an aspect to it, either a personal aspect or with the Aspect improvement. That way you can define it mechanically and concretely, if you go in for that sort of thing, plus you get added utility (and Fate Points) from it as an aspect.

## Impact
Choose one of your skills (whether Common, Unique or Strange). When you use that skill and succed with style, you can declare a fragile aspect on yourself, your opponent, or the scene (as appropriate) as a free action. EXAMPLES: Fisticuffs Impact, Resolve Impact, Investigation Impact.

## Skilled
Receive another 5 skill points.

## Theme
Choose three skills (whether Common, Unique or Strange) that share a thematic connection, such as Athletics, Brawn, and Alertness (physical fitness) or Academics, Art, and Science (education). Each of these skills receives one (and only one) of the following benefits. This Gift can be purchased multiple times, but no skill can ever receive more than one benefit.

* A +1 bonus in narrow circumstances, such as +1 Athletics when jumping, +1 Firearms with Electrophorous Firing Pieces, or +1 Fisticuffs when outnumbered.
* A +2 bonus when using that skill to maneuver or Block.
* Use the skill in place of another skill in narrow circumstances, such as using Brawn instead of Athletics when chasing someone, using Firearms instead of Athletics to defend against ranged attacks, or using Occultism instead of Presence to orate.
* Ignore circumstantial or environmental penalties equal to or less than the skill's rating.

> ## Difficulty and Power Tiers
> When attempting a simple action with a difficulty of a Power Tier higher than the skill you're using, replace one Fate die with a d6 per degree of difference. But instead of adding the result of the d6 to the roll, subtract it. Compare your effort to the target number, as usual, to determine your effect.

> For example, let's say you're attempting to pick Great (+4) (E) lock using your Good (+3) Burglary. Because the Power Tier of the task is one higher than your skill's Power Tier, you swap out a Fate die for a d6 and roll 3dF-1d6. Your result: --+-2, or -3. Adding that to your skill rating of Good (+3) yields a total effort of Mediocre (+0) -- not nearly good enough to defeat that lock. Spending 2 Fate Points to invoke two aspects, though, will give you the +4 you need to succeed.

### Weapons and Armor
Weapons bought as Equipment Gifts can inflict additional stress by taking the Deadly improvement. Multiple instances of Deadly on the same piece of Equipment are cumulative, up to a maximum of +3 stress. However, this can't increase the stress dealt by a weapon to more than twice the number of shifts obtained. For example, if you're attacking with a sword with Deadly x2 and you win the exchange by 1 shift, you'll deal 2 stress, not 3.

Similarly, Equipment with the Protective improvement absorbs stress, providing Armor equal to the number of Protective improvements taken (up to a maximum of Armor 3). If multiple pieces of Equipment with the Protective improvement are worn, only take the highest Armor value from any one of them.

Weapons and armor can also be represented by Strange skills, like a sword forged from meteoric iron or a breastplate fashioned from demon hide. A PC or NPC could conceivably have a Unique skill called, for example, Mail Coat, with the Resist Damage trapping, which would be rolled as a defense against physical attacks.

Otherwise, weapons and armor are merely window dressing. Those cultists may be armed with scimitars, but unless they were purchased as Equipment with the Deadly improvement, they're not any more deadly than their bare fists. So why use them? Apart from flavor and looking cool -- a vital factor behind nearly anything of any importance in a story -- fighting with weapons allows them to use Arms instead of Fisticuffs. This also means that there's a tactical advantage in disarming them, which gives the PCs something to do besides try to brain them. More significantly, though, it keeps the emphasis on the characters and their skills instead of handing the conflict over to whoever has the shiniest toys.

> ## Mental Weapons, Social Armor
Weapons and armor don't have to be restricted to purely physical conflicts. A beautiful ball gown can make you more persuasive; the Queen's favor can cast doubt on even the most vicious > rumors.
However, these are highly contextual advantages. That fancy dress might impress the lower classes, but your social betters aren't likely to take much notice --  especially if their clothes are even fancier. This makes it difficult to balance against their physical equivalents, and a big reason why the Equipment Gift is limited to tangible gear. Plus, mental and social assets such as these can be much more ephemeral. Stand beside a muddy road while a carriage goes by and that ball gown won't be so pretty anymore.
Keep all of that in mind before introducing "weapons" and "armor" into non-physical conflicts. If you still want to go for it, don't go overboard -- bonus stress and Armor should be reserved for key situations to maintain their specialness. These types of advantages should be cherished and hard to come by. They should also be more about flavor than anything else, so keep > the modifier to within +/- 3 stress.
They make for great short-term in-game rewards on the fly, as well. Did you host an especially well-received soiree for London's social elite last night? That might translate to Armor 2 \[Social\] for the next week or so as talk of the event buoys your reputation in upper class salons. (Although the working class? They could care less.)
> Follow the guidelines above and those in the Equipment Gift description, and you'll be in good shape.
